              little RP while we were waiting for KST to start.</i><br>
            <br>
            You glance at some stone benches.<br>
            <br>
            Gringer asks, "What is up people of the square?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No hats."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Gringer, you ask, "Do you have a hat?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Surely they are for sale somewhere."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No one wears hats."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's not the fashion."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I think they look nice. Dapper."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Do you have one?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "You see someone with a hat and you think,
            "That's a gentleman."."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "No, I'm not a gentleman."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well now we have to find a hat."<br>
            <br>
            <i>Insert much searching for hats.</i><br>
            <br>
            think Does anyone know where I can buy a hat?<br>
            You focus on projecting your thoughts...<br>
            Cast Roundtime 3 Seconds.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "We'll have to look in individuals' shops."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Or, alternately, hunt something that wears
            hats."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Like... gnomes?"<br>
            <br>
            You glance dubiously at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Don't they wear those little red caps?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Someone has a hat."<br>
            <br>
            You (Focused to Kaskha) [Local]: "Yeah? How much you want
            for it?"<br>
            Cast Roundtime 3 Seconds.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I hope they're not asking too much money."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "We need to play it cool. Don't come across as
            desperate."<br>
            <br>
            [Town Square, West]<br>
            Here in the midst of the town stretches the cobblestoned
            main bazaar, its lamplit lanes abuzz with traders and
            vendors hawking their wares at any hour of the day or
            night.&nbsp; Groups of citizens, discussing the day's events
            or preparing for nighttime hunts, gather around the doors of
            the merchants whose shops border the square.&nbsp; The
            gilded but peeling stone facade of the First Elanith Bank
            dominates this side of the square.<br>
            Also here: Kaskha<br>
            Obvious paths: north, east, south, west<br>
            Mnar followed.<br>
            <br>
            You turn to face Kaskha.<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha offers you a threadbare inky black hat.&nbsp; Click
            ACCEPT to accept the offer or DECLINE to decline it.&nbsp;
            The offer will expire in 30 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha grins sheepishly.<br>
            <br>
            You accept Kaskha's offer and are now holding a threadbare
            inky black hat.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Thank you so much."<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha says, "Absolutely."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "That is a nice hat."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Do you want to join us in.. using the hat?"<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha says, "Uhm."<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha says, "Well."<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha says, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha joins your group.<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            [Town Square, East]<br>
            Here in the center of a broad plaza near the commercial area
            of the bazaar stands the impressive facade of the
            slate-roofed Moot Hall, where the citizens of Wehnimer's
            Landing hold various official, religious and social
            functions.&nbsp; Facing the square are some of the town's
            more prosperous shops, still doing business with the many
            customers who still frequent the streets at night.&nbsp; You
            also see a tiger-claw, a large purple wooden barrel, a
            bone-framed bulletin board and a polished bleakstone statue.<br>
            Obvious paths: north, east, south, west<br>
            Mnar and Kaskha followed.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "SO."<br>
            <br>
            You gaze with interest at a polished bleakstone statue.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Can you reach?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "We're just going to improve the statue of the
            mayor a little bit."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha points at the Juspera disk.<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha says, "I'm sure you could use that to help reach."<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha says, "Stand on it, that is."<br>
            <br>
            Shattered pieces of porcelain arrive on an errant breeze and
            begin to assemble themselves before your very eyes.&nbsp; As
            the last pieces fit into place, they reveal Lylia, who now
            stands before you.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Those things are so wobbly though."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia nods in greeting.<br>
            <br>
            Mayor Lylia just entered the Moot Hall.<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Oh."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at the Moot Hall.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "That was almost bad."<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha laughs!<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera tries to stand on her disk, holding onto Mnar's
            shoulder.)<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Hurry before she comes back."<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha starts chortling.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I'm trying."<br>
            <br>
            You grit your teeth.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Kaskha says, "I've gotcha."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera tries to place the hat on top of the statue's
            smooth head. It falls off.)<br>
            <br>
            You drop a threadbare inky black hat.<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha flails her arms about.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar frowns.<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha picks up a threadbare inky black hat.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "You try."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Maybe if we had something sticky?"<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Do you have any glue?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Like, honey?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I just have boogers."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Honey is a good idea."<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha asks, "I've got a rediculous overcoat, too?"<br>
            <br>
            You nod emphatically at Kaskha!<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Oh that's nice."<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha asks, "Both, mayhaps?"<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Yes!"<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "And why stop there?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Someone in this town must have a fake beard, and
            some spectacles."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking absently to herself, Kaskha asks, "What did you get
            yourself into?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "And honey."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, you ask, "Yes, sweetie?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Not you, snookums."<br>
            <br>
            You snap your fingers.<br>
            <br>
            You settle your gaze on Kaskha, watching her intently.<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha blushes a pink hue to the tops of her ears.<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha fidgets.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Come on. You're taller than me."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Not saying much."<br>
            <br>
            You scowl at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            (Kaskha fumbles with the overcoat slightly as she attempts
            to drape it on the statue's shoulders. It slowly falls
            down.)<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha drops a luxurious aquamarine overcoat.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Oh, you're one to talk."<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha glances at a luxurious aquamarine overcoat.<br>
            <br>
            You glance with dismay at a luxurious aquamarine overcoat.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "No, like this."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Bleakstone is so curious."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar picks up a luxurious aquamarine overcoat.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "What a lush looking overcoat."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "You just, like..."<br>
            <br>
            (Mnar sort of gives the statues an awkward hug, attempting
            to drape the overcoat around its shoulders.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No, no."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I've almost got it."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera reaches around Mnar who is reaching around the
            statue, trying to hold the overcoat in place.)<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Try to jump a little."<br>
            <br>
            You glance incredulously at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera bounces a little on the balls of her feet, still
            pinning Mnar to the statue.)<br>
            <br>
            Mnar frowns at a polished bleakstone statue.<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha blushes a pink hue to the tops of her ears.<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha offers you a threadbare inky black hat.&nbsp; Click
            ACCEPT to accept the offer or DECLINE to decline it.&nbsp;
            The offer will expire in 30 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I think they greased it."<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha whispers, "Pardon."<br>
            <br>
            You accept Kaskha's offer and are now holding a threadbare
            inky black hat.<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha grins sheepishly.<br>
            <br>
            Kaskha just went south.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "We lost our accomplice."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera jumps again, trying to get the hat onto the top of
            the statue, and knocks her chin against Mnar's skull on the
            way down.)<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "The heat was too much for her."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar exclaims, "Ow!"<br>
            <br>
            You rub Mnar gently.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "None of this is any good if Lylia doesn't even
            come out of her office ever."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "She's so dull."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Did she pay for the statue?"<br>
            <br>
            Tanndrill just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            Tanndrill offers you a dark azure bonnet.&nbsp; Click ACCEPT
            to accept the offer or DECLINE to decline it.&nbsp; The
            offer will expire in 30 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No, it's odd."<br>
            <br>
            You accept Tanndrill's offer and are now holding a dark
            azure bonnet.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Oh, this is even better, thank you."<br>
            <br>
            Tanndrill waves.<br>
            <br>
            Lord Tanndrill just went west.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Do you want to--"<br>
            <br>
            You snap your fingers.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Like, I can't imagine that throngs of adoring
            townspeople put a fund together for it."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Some people were exploring the bleaklands... you
            know, where Talador used to be..."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "And they found a statue of her?"<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Anyway, some time after that, a merchant showed up
            offering this statue. As a gift I think?"<br>
            <br>
            You laugh out loud!<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No, that would be scary."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "That would be terrifying."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's bleakstone, which is what is in the
            bleaklands."<br>
            <br>
            You nod at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Least of all for her."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "The only thing worse would be if they found a
            statue of Silvean."<br>
            <br>
            You glance between a dark azure bonnet and a threadbare inky
            black hat.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Both."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "That's what I was thinking."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera tosses the hat as if playing ring-toss, trying to
            get it to land on the statue's head.)<br>
            <br>
            You drop a threadbare inky black hat.<br>
            <br>
            (Mnar drapes the overcoat as best he can around the statue's
            base.)<br>
            <br>
            Mnar drops a luxurious aquamarine overcoat.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, you say, "Lift me up."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Can't go wrong."<br>
            <br>
            (Mnar squats deep enough to wrap his arms around Juspera's
            thighs, then heaves her upward with a mostly concealed grunt
            of effort.)<br>
            <br>
            You raise your hand.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera drops the bonnet on the statue's head, where it
            clings, barely.)<br>
            <br>
            You drop a dark azure bonnet.<br>
            <br>
            Shinann just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Brilliant."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann nods in greeting.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Put me down."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            (Mnar sets Juspera back down with a muffled wheeze.)<br>
            <br>
            Mnar nods at Shinann.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Hello. Nothing untoward going on here."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera glances quickly at the bonnet, now sitting on top
            of the statue's head.)<br>
            <br>
            Shinann nods to Mnar in greeting.<br>
            <br>
            Shinann glances at a polished bleakstone statue.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "We're just..."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "We were waiting to talk to Lylia."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann asks, "I see.&nbsp; Can you get rid of that?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "About how lovely a job she's doing."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann points at a polished bleakstone statue.<br>
            <br>
            You flatly say, "No, I'm too short."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann snaps her fingers.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "She is, she really is."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "And heavy. The statue is too heavy, I mean."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Juspera is as light as a tuft of cotton."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "I thought one of you might know someone."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Oh, to get rid of the bonnet?"<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Statue?"<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "Statue."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I know a lot of people."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Shinann, you ask, "Do you not like it?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I mean, there's a bay just a few streets down."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "No."<br>
            <br>
            You nod at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "There is. A big bay."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "Cannot go into the bay."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "You don't like it? Or you don't not like it?"<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "Has to go back to the Bleaklands."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "That seems extreme."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "I do not like it."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Oh, because of the bleakstone."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann nods at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Maybe it's haunted."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Probably."<br>
            <br>
            You knock upon a polished bleakstone statue.<br>
            <br>
            You turn your ear toward a polished bleakstone statue.&nbsp;
            Sounds about like you expected.<br>
            <br>
            (Mnar suddenly looks at the statue with new interest.)<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "I believe it is what is causing everything to
            rot and people to become ill."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "Some have died."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Shinann, you say, "Did they..."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Haunted with the souls of all the people Lylia
            has slain."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Shinann, you ask, "Find it like this in the
            bleaklands? Already carved?"<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "To look like Lylia?"<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "No, it was delivered one night."<br>
            <br>
            You nod at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes, and all the children whose candy she's
            stolen."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Well, how do we know, really?"<br>
            <br>
            You cock your head and examine the bleakstone statue.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It could have been found like this in the
            bleaklands."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Perhaps they worship her there."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "We tried to stop them from coming into the
            town, but they had papers."<br>
            <br>
            You furrow your brow, probably adding a wrinkle or two in
            the process.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I also thought it was a bit odd."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Has Lylia commented on this thing's odd
            provenance?"<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "Well, the witch took her blood and that is an
            amazing likeness of her and she did not sit for it."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Huh."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "So it's like..."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Well, I mean."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "All dark elves kinda look the same, you know."<br>
            <br>
            You glance sharply at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "The witch used her blood to make the bleakstone
            look like her?"<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Then had it delivered?"<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "That is just my theory."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Does she love Lylia or something?"<br>
            <br>
            Shinann asks, "Do you smell the rot?&nbsp; Have you seen the
            withered grass and trees?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I... there were some fissures earlier."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar scans his surroundings with the alertness of a seasoned
            scout.<br>
            <br>
            Shinann points north.<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "One there."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "Two others."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera leans forward and -- skittishly, hesitatingly --
            just barely prods the statue's butt with a fingertip.)<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Shinann.<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "They came later."<br>
            <br>
            (OOC) Shinann's player whispers, "LOL."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Has no one else raised these concerns? They seem
            rather... obvious."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "Yes, but there is nothing we can do right
            now."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann slowly empties her lungs.<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "I wonder if Lylia would wear that
            bonnet?&nbsp; I think you should gift it to her, but do not
            tell her it was my idea."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "She doesn't seem like a hat person..."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "It would contaminate the bay if my theory is
            correct."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yeah, I guess so."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Well, there's lots of contaminated places around
            here."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Still, not like that bay's that clean anyway."<br>
            <br>
            You nod at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Like, just toss a stone."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Like your mind."<br>
            <br>
            You chuckle at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Probably lands in a..."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar squints at you.<br>
            <br>
            <i>More people arrive and we discuss Pylasar, whether
              bleakstone or blood marble is 'natural,' etc. Someone
              mentions the hats.</i><br>
            <br>
            (Juspera glances again at the bonnet, which is perched on
            top of the head of the statue.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "We were..."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Like, what if some old mentor appears out of his
            thoughts, and suddenly... look, the hats were there when we
            got here."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes, the hats were here."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They were always here."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "On the statue."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I just assumed they were part of the
            decoration."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "As was the cloak."<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart glances at a polished bleakstone statue.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Right, part of the sculptor's design."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "Was here when I got here."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "The artist's intent."<br>
            <br>
            Shallimar deeply says, "But.... you were searching for
            hats."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "A bleakstone-and-textile masterpiece."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yeah, my head was cold."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar pets a bright-eyed darkly clouded kitten with elongated
            tufty ears and a spiked veil iron collar.<br>
            The darkly clouded kitten squirms and twists away from him.<br>
            <br>
            You snicker.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, you say, "You don't pet it right."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Pet it like this."<br>
            <br>
            You pet the darkly clouded kitten.<br>
            Tiny paws knead the ground as the darkly clouded kitten
            purrs slightly.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "If everyone who is looking for a hat is guilty
            of some crime, then I guess we're all guilty."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Right. Who among us has never sought a hat?"<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart says, "I hae nae."<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart says, "Well..I take that back."<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart says, "I did seek a tam one time."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Don't knights have to shave the top of their
            heads?"<br>

            Cryheart says, "Nuns do wear short hair...very short."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Huh."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No wonder they can never get a man."<br>

            Balantine quietly says, "Greetings all."<br>

            You say, "We were just talking about what to do with the
