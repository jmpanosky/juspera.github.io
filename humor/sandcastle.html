            [River's Rest, Narrow Point]<br>
            Surrounded by water, this narrow strip of beach offers a
            clear view of Maelstrom Bay and a larger body of water to
            the south.&nbsp; Small shells litter the beach and an
            occasional crab scuttles quickly to the safety of the water,
            leaving a tell-tale track in the soft sands which is soon
            erased by the gentle breezes.&nbsp; To the east, the
            mainland seems far away from this quiet and peaceful corner
            of the island.&nbsp; You also see a River's Rest Militia
            banner.<br>
            Obvious paths: out<br>
            Rastavan, Rekarth, Mekthros and Divid followed.<br>
            <br>
            The words "River's Rest Militia" have been carefully
            embroidered above the image of a fortressed garrison.&nbsp;
            The silvery green banner, now faded and showing signs of
            wear, is marred by dark reddish splotches staining the once
            elegant material.&nbsp; Around the edges are stitched the
            names of old battles.<br>
            <br>
            Divid says, "It isn't safe here."<br>
            <br>
            You put a small razor-sharp hatchet in your cloak.<br>
            <br>
            You sling a burnished imflass buckler over your shoulder.<br>
            <br>
            (Rastavan buries the point of his sonic rapier in the
            sand.&nbsp; Of course, once he takes his hand off of it, it
            dissipates.)<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "It isn't?"<br>
            <br>
            A krolvin mercenary ambles in.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Surely this banner proves--"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros gestures.<br>
            A sense of peace and calm settles over the area.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Ooh."<br>
            You say, "Now."<br>
            <br>
            You remove an iron bucket from in your cloak.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera begins making a hole with her boot, then goes to
            the water and puts some in the bucket, then pours it in the
            hole.)<br>
            <br>
            Rastavan says, "At least you remembered the bucket."<br>
            <br>
            Divid forages briefly and manages to find a yabathilium
            fruit!<br>
            <br>
            (Rastavan starts digging a moat around where the castle will
            be built.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera keeps pouring water in the hole until it stops
            being absorbed.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros forages around briefly but doesn't seem to find
            anything useful.<br>
            Mekthros forages around briefly but doesn't seem to find
            anything useful.<br>

            Mekthros forages around briefly but doesn't seem to find
            anything useful.<br>
            Divid forages briefly and manages to find a yabathilium
            fruit!<br>
            Mekthros forages around briefly but doesn't seem to find
            anything useful.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera begins pushing a pile of sand toward Rastavan.)<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Don't you want to make a sandcastle, Rekarth?"<br>
            <br>
            (Rastavan takes a handful of sand and plops it down.&nbsp;
            He then starts shaping what appears to be a tower.)<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera pushes a lot of sand into a pile a foot high.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth stares thoughtfully at the mound of sand.)<br>
            <br>
            Divid forages around briefly but doesn't seem to find
            anything useful.<br>
            Mekthros forages around briefly but doesn't seem to find
            anything useful.<br>
            Divid forages around briefly but doesn't seem to find
            anything useful.<br>
            Mekthros forages around briefly but doesn't seem to find
            anything useful.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They're looking for pretty rocks."<br>
            <br>
            Rastavan says, "Ahhhhhhh"<br>
            <br>
            Divid says, "Maybe shells."<br>
            <br>
            (Rastavan picks up a flat piece of driftwood and places it
            across the moat.)<br>
            <br>
            Rastavan says, "Drawbridge."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera sprinkles some of the water onto some sand she is
            shaping into another tower a couple feet from Rastavan's.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rastavan grabs another couple handfulls of sand and starts
            building a structure inbetween the two towers.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera cups her hand around the sand until a lumpy
            cylinder has formed.)<br>
            <br>
            Divid forages briefly and manages to find a yabathilium
            fruit!<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Those would look nice on the towers."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Upside-down."<br>
            <br>
            Rastavan says, "ooooh"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Like little domes."<br>
            <br>
            Rastavan nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Rastavan forages around briefly but doesn't seem to find
            anything useful.<br>
            <br>
            (Rastavan begins to sprinkle some water on the building he's
            working on and obviously thinks Juspera needs to be watered
            as well, for he splashes some at her.)<br>
            <br>
            How can they be so mean to you?!<br>
            <br>
            Rastavan says, "Oh, I'm sorry."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "We'll get no work done that way."<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth picks up a largish bit of shell, contemplating it
            for a few moments.)<br>
            <br>
            Rastavan says, "That was a mistake, really."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera dribbles some more water onto her forming tower to
            hold it together better.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rastavan begins building a second level to the castle.)<br>
            <br>
            d100(Open): 50<br>
            You forage around but find nothing of interest.<br>
            Roundtime: 7 sec.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera takes a stick and shaves off the top of her tower,
            leaving it flat, then forms some crennelations.)<br>
            <br>
            You remove some tattered cloth from in your cloak.<br>
            <br>
            Rastavan asks, "ooh, are those crennelations?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera puts the tattered cloth on the stick, then sticks
            the stick in the top of her tower.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I should have put a design on it."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I don't have anything to draw with."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros offers you a long raven feather quill.&nbsp; Enter
            ACCEPT to accept the offer or DECLINE to decline it.&nbsp;
            The offer will expire in 30 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera glances at the militia banner, then tries to draw
            the same garrison on the tattered cloth, holding her palm
            behind it.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth murmurs a few arcane phrases, then rubs the bit of
            shell between his fingers, slowly disintegrating it to
            nothingness.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros accepts Divid's yabathilium fruit.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "I only need one."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Put one on top of Rastavan's tower."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Oh, you want them for your own castles?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "I want them for when a corsair takes my arm
            off."<br>
            <br>
            (Rastavan finishes the second level, and seems to be done
            working on the sandcastle.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            (Divid begins drawing in the sand.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well, get to work."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera pinches her hands together to make a wall
            connecting her tower to Rastavan's work.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rastavan wanders over to the water and washes the sand off
            his hands.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera dribbles water on the forming wall, building it up
            higher.)<br>
            <br>
            Rastavan says, "Alright, time for this bard to get some
            sleep."<br>
            <br>
            Rastavan says, "Goodnight everyone."<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth stares off over the bay, apparently ignoring the
            nearby weed-rummaging and granular engineering.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth nods absently to Rastavan.)<br>
            <br>
            Rastavan just left.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera presses the side of her finger into the top of the
            wall, making more crennelations.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Use consummate v's, consummate."<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros points emphatically at the castle before turning
            away in ignorance.)<br>
            <br>
            You see Mekthros foraging around, but he doesn't seem to
            find anything useful.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Consummate Vs?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros exclaims, "Consummate!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Vvvvvvvv."<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth closes his eyes for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Do you hear the peeping tree snakes?"<br>
            <br>
            Divid asks, "Peeping tree snakes?"<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth asks, "Peeping tree snakes?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "You're hearing things."<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I am hearing peeping tree snakes."<br>
            <br>
            Divid says, "I didn't think peeping tree snakes made noise."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Nor did I."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They peep."<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth says, "Ah.&nbsp; Good for you, then."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera makes a few quiet peeping noises.)<br>
            <br>
            Divid asks, "So, uh... they make a 'peeping' sound?"<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera cups a hand to her ear.)<br>
            <br>
            (Divid draws a line in the sand with his foot.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth tosses a small stone into the water.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera gets more water with the bucket and pours it in the
            moat.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera pokes some divots for windows into the side of her
            tower.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera gets a forklike stick and places it on top of one
            of Rastavan's towers.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "You shouldn't play with Rastavan's tower."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He left."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Excuses."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I put a person in it."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Did you."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros asks, "Who?"<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth says, "Someone will likely step on it before he
            returns, anyway."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Charl will take it back to the sea."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's me in a tower."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Ah."<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros simulates the tower burning with a small elemental
            flare.)<br>
            <br>
            You furrow up your face and wince.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Aa.&nbsp; Aa.&nbsp; Let me out."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "We're dying."<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Oh no!"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "The smoke... the smoke."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera tosses some water on the tower.)<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth smiles slightly.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Just like when Draezir came."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "You were too late.&nbsp; Innocent lives were
            lost by your failure to extinguish the flames in time."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Yes, when you all burned to death in that
            room."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros sighs pleasantly.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Now we must begin repairs."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera spackles some new sand onto the tower sides.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera gathers a bunch of sticks and jabs them into the
            sand at odd angles around the moat.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera places a thick stick on the top of another tower,
            then a curved stick at its end, making a kind of T.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Now we have ballista power."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera takes some pebbles and sets them up a foot before
            the castle, lining them in ranks.)<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros looks at the sand castle with a ponderous
            expression.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth glances at the irregularly-shaped mound of sand.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera places some pebbles on the castle wall.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "The Illistim mages have arrived."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Now you should fireball the army outside the
            gates."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros gets a match from a wooden matchbox.<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth removes a froth-filled green glass jar from in his
            veniom mesh sack.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros lights a match by flicking it against his thumb.<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth fishes a few eyes out of his jar.)<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros drops a match on the small collection of
            rocks.&nbsp; It burns quietly on the sand.)<br>
            <br>
            You applaud.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Good shot."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I should do that."<br>
            <br>
            You get a match from your wooden matchbox.<br>
            <br>
            You light the match by flicking it against your thumb.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera hurls the match at the collection of pebbles in
            ranks.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth picks up a jellyfish with a stick, then attaches
            the eyes to it.)<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth menaces the sandcastle with his...&nbsp; Whatever
            it is.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's the miscere'golab."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros removes a pewter Koar miniature from in his black
            elven robes.<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth asks, "Is it?"<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros makes his pewter Koar miniature fight Rekarth's
            random inanimate piece of goo.&nbsp; The Koar miniature
            falls over, clearly defeated.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Hey."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Now I have to save the day."<br>
            <br>
            You light the match by flicking it against your thumb.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera hurls her match right at Rekarth from the position
            of the stick on the tower.)<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth blinks.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera turns the ballista around.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth brushes the smoking bit of stick from his pants.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Catapult."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera picks up a twig and flings it at the jellyfish,
            where it sticks.)<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Are we beating the jellyfish?"<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth dangles the impaled jellyfish over the sandcastle.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Hm."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera tilts the forked stick sideways, trying to stab
            into the jellyfish.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth pauses a moment, peering at the thing on the end of
            the stick.)<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros appears to be necromantically animating the dead
            figure of Koar.&nbsp; It attempts to sabotage the
            catapult.&nbsp; Many soldiers die in a futile defense.)<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth says, "Hrmm.&nbsp; I wonder where that other eye
            went."<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Hey!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I knocked the eye out."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "You have to take the eyes out to kill it."<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth says, "Ah.&nbsp; Very well."<br>
            <br>
            You remove a snobbish coppery brown canvas scout toy from in
            your cloak.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera walks the giant scout toy into the castle, where
            it's nearly as tall as the towers.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Now, Mnar is here."<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth says, "And look, that sand-mite is getting away with
            the...&nbsp; Little...&nbsp; Whatever that is."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's war."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera makes the scout toy pound at the jellyfish.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros asks, "Will its ego fit on the battlefield?"<br>
            Mekthros ponders.<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth flops the jellyfish onto the scout toy.)<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Aaaaaa!"<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth says, "Now that doesn't look terribly dignified."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera lets the toy fall, suffocating under the
            jellyfish.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Mnar dies."<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth pokes at the jellyfish-enshrouded scout toy with
            his stick.)<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros appears to be necromantically animating
            Mnar.&nbsp; The process fails, however, because Mnar is too
            badly mangled.)<br>
            <br>
            You remove an old crone doll from in your cotton haversack.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Hey."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's... Harith."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera walks Harith toward the castle, but has her trip
            and do a head-plant in the sand.)<br>
            <br>
            The old crone doll is dressed in what appears to be the rags
            cast off by an unsuccessful beggar.&nbsp; Wisps of nearly
            colorless hair lie matted on her pale, knobby skull.&nbsp;
            Her few remaining teeth are stained an unnatural
            brown.&nbsp; Her jaw is distended by a massive wad of
            chewing tobacco.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;drop harith<br>
            I could not find what you were referring to.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;drop doll<br>
            You drop an old crone doll.<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth stares thoughtfully at Juspera for a moment, then
            gives the scout toy another good poke with his stick.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros removes a brushed steel message worm from in his
            black elven robes.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera makes the scout toy twitch.)<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Save me Juspera!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Ooh."<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros moves his worm to flank Harith, pulling her head
            from the sand.)<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Is that a roa'ter?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Roa'ter."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros nods.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "There should be roa'ters on the battlefield."<br>
            <br>
            You remove a slender copper message worm from in your blue
            velvet skirt.<br>
            <br>
            You drop a slender copper message worm.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros drops a brushed steel message worm.<br>
            <br>
            [River's Rest, Narrow Point]<br>
            Surrounded by water, this narrow strip of beach offers a
            clear view of Maelstrom Bay and a larger body of water to
            the south.&nbsp; Small shells litter the beach and an
            occasional crab scuttles quickly to the safety of the water,
            leaving a tell-tale track in the soft sands which is soon
            erased by the gentle breezes.&nbsp; To the east, the
            mainland seems far away from this quiet and peaceful corner
            of the island.&nbsp; You also see a brushed steel message
            worm, a slender copper message worm, an old crone doll and a
            River's Rest Militia banner.<br>
            Also here: Mekthros who is sitting, Lord Rekarth who is
            sitting<br>
            Obvious paths: out<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera has the forked stick jump down onto the back of the
            jellyfish.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera stabs messily at the jellyfish with the forked
            stick.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth passes his hand over the scout toy.&nbsp; The
            jellyfish begins to writhe, then its dead form crawls from
            the toy, gallumphing a few feet away before erupting in an
            explosion of whatever it is that composes those things.)<br>
            <br>
            You shudder.<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth smiles slightly.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Did we kill it?"<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth says, "Yes.&nbsp; Mnar must have struck off that
            last eye as it felled him."<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros has one of the message worms brutally dismember
            a... rock-guard-thing... near the entrance to the castle.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth pokes the scout toy with his stick again.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera makes the toy flop over.)<br>
            <br>
            You remove a small snake from in your cotton haversack.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera pulls the snake over to the crone doll, leaving a
            trail in the sand.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Now, while they relish their victory, we will
            reanimate you, yesssss..."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera sprinkles some water on the crone doll and makes it
            rise up.)<br>
            <br>
            Divid blinks.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Now, destroy them... I am going to get a ham
            sssssandwich..."<br>
            <br>
            Divid asks in Elven, "Where'd all those come from?"<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera drags the snake away.)<br>
            <br>
            You put a small snake in your cotton haversack.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They're fighting."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "See the roa'ters."<br>
            <br>
            Divid exclaims, "Oh!"<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth picks up one of the fallen eyes, examining it for a
            moment.&nbsp; He tosses the sandy orb at the castle.)<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "The castle is under attack!"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros removes some beryl and ruby dice from in his black
            elven robes.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera has the crone doll stomp toward the sandcastle,
            huge in comparison to the towers.)<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros has one of the worms burrow under the sand and
            explode below the soldiers.&nbsp; Dice-debris... stuff...
            flies everywhere, killing many and maiming others.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros shakes some dice and rolls them on the ground.<br>
            The dice bounce a few times and come to rest on 4 and 6.<br>
            <br>
            You deeply exclaim, "Harith smash!"<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera walks the crone doll right through a castle wall.)<br>
            <br>
            Divid says, "I'm amused."<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Oh no! She has the strength of a banshee who
            has the strength of two banshees!"<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth clears his throat.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros ponders.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Wait.."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros asks, "Wouldn't that just be two banshees?"<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth blinks at Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera just turns the ballista around to face Harith.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera drops a stick on Harith.)<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth removes a glimmering opalescent scarab from in his
            veniom mesh sack.<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth walks the scarab over to the crone doll, then drags
            away the stick.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's..."<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth gazes thoughtfully at his opalescent scarab.<br>
            <br>
            You sheepishly ask, "What is it?"<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth asks, "A giant bug...&nbsp; Of...&nbsp; Err...&nbsp;
            Doom?"<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera makes the crone doll's arm smash down more of the
            sand wall.)<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Harith must be stopped!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "We need Ulstram."<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth menaces the sandcastle with his 'giant bug of
            DOOM!')<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera takes another stick and wraps it in some white
            cloth.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Hey."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera sticks the stick into the tallest tower.)<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros makes carnage with the two message worms,
            decimating the guard forces and splattering rock-gore
            everywhere.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Begone, Harith."<br>
            <br>
            You gesture at an old crone doll.<br>
            The doll vibrates slightly but nothing else happens.<br>
            Cast Roundtime 3 Seconds.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Your psionical usurping machinations are not
            wanted here."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And leave Juspera alone."<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth sets the scarab rather precariously on the nearest
            tower, then watches it tumble to the ground.)<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth ponders.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Is the bug of doom dead?"<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth says, "Perhaps.&nbsp; It is difficult to tell with
            those sorts of things."<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros summons a demon.&nbsp; Really.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros drops a bloodwood demoness statue.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Hey."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera brings her forked stick up to stand beside
            Ulstram.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Let's vanquish them."<br>
            <br>
            You gesture at a bloodwood demoness statue.<br>
            The statue vibrates slightly but nothing else happens.<br>
            Cast Roundtime 3 Seconds.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera picks up a handful of golden sand and rains it down
            from Ulstram's position.)<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros advances his demoness towards Ulstram while token
            killing several small fry soldiers on the way.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Oh, no."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera rains another handful of sand on it.)<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros has his demoness stagger and fall to the
            ground.&nbsp; It launches a large rock towards Ulstram's
            forked stick as it dies.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Aaaaaaaa...."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera makes the Ulstram stick topple backwards off the
            tower and plant headfirst into the sand.)<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Oh no!"<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "I lost Mnar and Ulstram on the same day!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I'm enraged."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Ah well.&nbsp; You'll get over it."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera makes the forked stick jump from the tower onto the
            crone doll.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera stabs at the crone doll.)<br>
            &gt;<br>
            Rekarth chuckles.<br>
            <br>
            You weakly exclaim, "You may have killed me Juspera, but as
            a parting gift, I will break your mind!"<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "No!"<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera drops the crone doll and sends the forked stick on
            a rampage, tearing up the sandcastle.)<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth smiles slightly.<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth stifles a yawn.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Then Charl sees the disaster and is unhappy, and
            wreaks his wrath upon everyone."<br>
            <br>
            You stand back up.<br>
            <br>
            You remove an iron bucket from in your cloak.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera fills the bucket in the ocean and drowns the
            sandcastle in one wet splash.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Charl is a bastard like that."<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth says, "Yes.&nbsp; He did that to me, once."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera watches things float around until the water is
            absorbed.)<br>
            <br>
            You pick up a slender copper message worm.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera wipes the worm on her skirt.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rekarth glances at the remains of the jellyfish, then
            shakes his head.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera smashes the sand further with her boot.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera keeps stomping, her boots making sucking sounds
            against the wet sand.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros looks thoughtfully at you.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera begins stomping harder, smashing her feet against
            the sand and sending little droplets of moisture flying.)<br>
            <br>
            You grunt.<br>
            <br>
            You suddenly stumble for no apparent reason.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Now, let's go to bed."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros says, "Good idea."<br>
            <br>
            Rekarth says, "Not a bad idea."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "In Prata's hammock."</span></font></p>
