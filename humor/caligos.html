              we meet with a very entertaining half-krolvin and all
              become increasingly more intoxicated as the night goes on.
              Slightly NSFW. This happened on October 4, 2019 on Caligos

            <i>A blood rain begins to fall.</i><br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily asks, "Ar am I still hallucinatin?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar scowls.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium says, "No.&nbsp; We're getting filthy with gore."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus runs a hand over his black tunic, wiping off the
            accumulated gore.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "This is going to take forever to clean."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas issues a muted bark that transforms into a keening
            yowl of sorrow.<br>

            [Siren's Call Tavern, Bar - 26487]<br>
            A mild hint of wood varnish lingers in the air, mingled with
            the aroma of dark ale, spirits, and the twang of cigar
            smoke.&nbsp; Centered on the back wall is a carved teak bar,
            and over it hangs a tremendous circular mirror behind glass
            shelves illuminated in wan jewel-toned hues.&nbsp;
            Suede-cushioned stools sit beneath the edge of the counter,
            which is topped with clean-shaded lamps at intervals.&nbsp;
            A narrow stairway leads up to the mezzanine.&nbsp; You also
            see a coin-wielding rotund broker, a dusky blue-skinned
            half-krolvin and some inviting tables.<br>
            Obvious exits: southwest<br>
            Thrassus, Karkas, Cruxophim, Mnar and Xanthium followed.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Ugh."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Thrassus, Xanthium asks, "Would you mind?&nbsp;
            Before my blouse stains?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Thrassus, you say, "Me too."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus gestures at Xanthium.<br>
            Water sprays forth and scours Xanthium clean!<br>
            A large splash of water drenches Xanthium from head to toe!<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium shivers.<br>
            <br>
            (Karkas dips his head forward so that the bloody rainwater
            runs out of his tricorne.)<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus gestures at you.<br>
            Water sprays forth and scours you clean!<br>
            A splash of water hits you squarely, drenching you from head
            to toe!<br>
            <br>
            You glance at your white linen shirt.<br>
            <br>
            You fold your arms over your chest.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas cackles!<br>
            <br>
            You mumble something under your breath.<br>
            <br>
            Damp trickles of water drip from the ends of your hair.<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Don't look!"<br>
            <br>
            You turn around.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Mnar asks, "At what?"<br>
            <br>
            You scowl.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar grins.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking soothingly to you, Cruxophim coaxes, "There there,
            dear."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim fans his blood red-veined deep black wings at you,
            stirring the air into a small, focused breeze that swirls
            about you.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthium runs her long fingers through her now-drenched
            hair, looking it over critically for clumps of scarlet.)<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, you say, "Thank you."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas whistles tunelessly to himself.<br>
            <br>
            (OOC) Cruxophim's player whispers to the group, "LOL, water
            spells."<br>
            <br>
            (OOC) You quietly whisper to Cruxophim, "Lolol!"<br>
            <br>
            Your white linen shirt clings damply about your chest and
            waist.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas wiggles his eyebrows at you.<br>
            <br>
            You glance sharply at Karkas.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas winks at you.<br>
            <br>
            (OOC) Xanthium's player whispers to the group, "Time for the
            wet tshirt contest."<br>
            <br>
            (OOC) Cruxophim's player whispers to the group, "Hubba
            hubba."<br>
            <br>
            (OOC) You whisper, "Yeah Mnar." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            (OOC) Mnar's player whispers to the group, "Half-elf would
            win."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium smiles at you.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium asks, "What'd I do now?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Nothing."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily asks, "Whar's the booze in this
            establishmen?"<br>
            <br>
            You point at a carved teak bar.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Har."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas pours himself a glass of spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim offers you a glass of spiced rum.&nbsp; Click
            ACCEPT to accept the offer or DECLINE to decline it.&nbsp;
            The offer will expire in 30 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            You accept Cruxophim's offer and are now holding a glass of
            spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas sniffs at his spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking amusedly to Xanthium, Cruxophim suggests, "This
            seems you."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim offers Xanthium a bright orange ginger-peach
            cocktail rimmed in slivers of candied ginger.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium grins at Cruxophim.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium accepts Cruxophim's ginger-peach cocktail.<br>
            <br>
            (Karkas holds his pinky straight up as he sips his rum.)<br>
            <br>
            Karkas takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Xanthium says, "I wouldn't
            know.&nbsp; Despite the stereotype about singers I don't
            often imbibe.&nbsp; But I'll be a sport."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium takes a drink from her ginger-peach cocktail.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "This is only my third drink tonight."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim offers Mnar a tumbler of sloe gin garnished with a
            lime slice and a cherry.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Mnar, Karkas says, "Yar quiet alla time
            now, lubber... I'm startin ta miss yar banter."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium asks, "Do you want to feed your
            kitty?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium looks thoughtfully at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I'm seeing if she wants to come in."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, you say, "You should feed her."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "She doesn't like strange buildings."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus says, "Animals won't enter this tavern for some
            reason."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "Someone asked me if I
            wanted to trap lobsters with them earlier, now looking at
            the bar I guess it wasn't a euphemism."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium glances at a carved teak bar.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium takes a drink from her ginger-peach cocktail.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Xanthium says, "This is good."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim nods eagerly at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Mnar, Karkas says, "Ya should feed 'er
            that fat fellar thar."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas nods to the rotund broker.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar glances at a coin-wielding rotund broker.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to a coin-wielding rotund broker, Karkas
            says, "Ya should let tha' kitty eat yar leg li' it did
            mine."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Clearly it was provoked."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Xanthium says, "I wonder if you even
            remember what actually happened to your leg at this point."<br>
            <br>
            You snicker.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium nods at Karkas.<br>
            <br>
            (Karkas pinky up, takes another staggering swig of his rum.)<br>
            <br>
            Karkas takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim raises his human skull in a toast and proclaims:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To the curmudgeonly among us, may you
            drink in surly and judgmental silence!"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking sternly to Xanthium, Karkas says, "Shark ate it."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Xanthium says, "I thought it was the
            kitty here."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Mnar, Karkas says, "Tha one is talkin
            'bout you."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar snorts!<br>
            <br>
            Mnar takes a drink from his sloe gin.<br>
            Mnar looks rather relaxed.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Xanthium, Karkas says, "Not THA' kitty."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium glances at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium whispers, "He's awfully pretty."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium whispers, "Both of them, really."<br>
            <br>
            Oddly, you see Karkas attempting to lick himself.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking affably to Xanthium, Cruxophim inquires, "So, how
            are the parentals?"<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Xanthium, "Mnar and Karkas?"<br>
            <br>
            You scratch your head.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Xanthium says, "On Teras murdering
            sirens."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking bemusedly to Xanthium, Cruxophim notes, "Sounds
            about right."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Xanthium says, "I'd ask about your
            own but you don't really look..."<br>
            <br>
            You snicker.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Xanthium muses, "...born."<br>
            <br>
            You chuckle at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "All this talk a mardar."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily exclaims, "That's a serious charge!"<br>
            <br>
            Karkas takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            You hopefully ask, "What about me? Don't I look like I was
            hewn from stone?"<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas nods slowly to you.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Mnar asks, "Found on a porch?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to you, Karkas says, "Ya do, lass...a fine,
            ashy marble."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas shivers.<br>
            <br>
            You smile at Karkas.<br>
            <br>
            You fidget.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking pleasantly to you, Cruxophim asserts, "Chiselled,
            certainly."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas agrees with Cruxophim.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar is admiring you.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "You look young and
            sprightly."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "...yes."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium asks, "Like me, no?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, you say, "Yes but more seasoned."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar takes a drink from his sloe gin.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Li' she'd cut tha wang offa chicken
            jus ta watch it fly in carcles."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "Marinated."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, you ask, "...the what?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "...you are a few cocktails
            in."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to you, Karkas says, "Wang, yar."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus blinks at Karkas.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Flap, flap...wang."<br>
            <br>
            You blink at Karkas.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "A rooster, you mean."<br>
            <br>
            (Karkas makes overly exaggerated flapping motions with his
            arms.)<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim slips a hand to his ankle, deftly retrieving a
            black-veined jawbone dagger.<br>
            <br>
            a gangly black-feathered rooster appears on the floor.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim glances at a gangly black-feathered rooster.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Due to how lich interacts... or fails to interact... with
              the Wizard FE, I sometimes miss lines; I think that might
              have been the case here. Anyway, there's a rooster.</i><br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Mnar, Karkas says, "Aye, a cock."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Right, like that."<br>
            <br>
            You point at a gangly black-feathered rooster!<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim glances between Karkas and a gangly
            black-feathered rooster.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "This will end well."<br>
            <br>
            A gangly black-feathered rooster spreads its wings and flaps
            them wildly but gets absolutely nowhere.<br>
            <br>
            You grimace.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim flashes a wide grin.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily exclaims, "If yar cuts its wang off it'll fly
            in carcles!!"<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim circles around a gangly black-feathered rooster in
            an overly exaggerated predatory manner, brandishing his
            jawbone dagger in mock threat it.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily exclaims, "Do yars not get it?!"<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus says, "It's head, you mean."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Nar."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium says, "...wang...cut off."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily exclaims, "Its WANG!"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium nods once.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Uh..."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Flap flap, WANGS."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim can offer Karkas only a blank expression.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim bursts out in loud, raucous laughter.<br>
            <br>
            You shift your weight.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus says, "I see."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus nods at Karkas.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus pours himself a glass of spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily exclaims, "What they fly with!"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "They're delicious."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily exclaims, "Thar wangs!"<br>
            <br>
            Karkas nods at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Their wings."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "The lubber's got it."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Wings."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "Aren't you lubberly."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium kisses you on the cheek.<br>
            <br>
            You wave your hand in a dismissive gesture.<br>
            <br>
            You smile at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to you, Karkas says, "WANGS."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well I knew that."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Because why would it fly around in circles if you
            cut its cock off?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar coughs.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "Especially now that you're
            not covered in blood.&nbsp; And you look all pink and
            flushed."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium glances at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas blinks at you.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to you, Karkas says, "Well now, lass...ain'
            no need ta be talkin bouts cuttin THOSE off."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Mnar says, "Rather cruel of her."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, you say, "It's your fault."<br>
            <br>
            A gangly black-feathered rooster spreads its wings and flaps
            them wildly but gets absolutely nowhere.<br>
            <br>
            You glance sternly at a gangly black-feathered rooster.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to you, Karkas exclaims, "I'm talkin abouts
            thar wang and yar talkin about cocks!"<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, you say, "Yes, but. I feel you started
            it."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Mnar says, "Not the first time, either."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "By not enunciating."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus pinches himself hard.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            You mumble something under your breath.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily exclaims, "Yar scarin tha farty two hells
            outta me now!"<br>
            <br>
            Wide-eyed, Karkas flinches away from you and makes several
            quiet, nervous barks.<br>
            <br>
            You bite your lip.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking slowly to Karkas, Cruxophim mouths, "The ~what
            hells?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "That's a, uh, traditional Krol saying."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking slowly to Cruxophim, Karkas says, "FARTY an' TWO."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Farty two."<br>
            <br>
            (Karkas holds up seven fingers.)<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Farty two."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            Thrassus looks rather relaxed.<br>

            Thrassus takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            Thrassus looks rather relaxed.<br>

            Thrassus takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera is now biting both lips between her teeth.)<br>
            <br>
            Mnar takes a drink from his sloe gin.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas belches.<br>
            <br>
            a white-tailed silvery grey goat appears on the floor.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Uh."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at a white-tailed silvery grey goat.<br>
            <br>
            (Karkas repositions his pinky upward.)<br>
            <br>
            Karkas takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            Karkas looks rather relaxed.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking dubiously to you, Cruxophim ventures, "No?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, you say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium snickers.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Wait, where'd it go."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Goat is good."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas licks his lips.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas winks at you.<br>
            <br>
            a white-tailed silvery grey goat appears on the floor.<br>
            <br>
            The goat moves out of Cruxophim's reach before he can touch
            it.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Goat from nowhere."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim flexes his fingers and extends them toward a
            white-tailed silvery grey goat as if to tickle it, but then
            shakes his head at the last minute and pulls his hand back.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera gropes along the bar blindly.)<br>
            <br>
            You pour yourself a glass of spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            The goat moves out of Cruxophim's reach before he can touch
            it.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Is it just one goat, or can you summon several?"<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim spreads his blood red-veined deep black wings wide
            and fans them at the goat in a clear attempt at
            intimidation.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Summon one on top of the other one."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Make the goat ride the other goat."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "If ya see a harny goat, best go tha
            othar way, befar he gets ta rammin."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium says, "Summon another and lash it onto a chariot."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim amusedly warns, "There's a limit to breaking
            spacial barriers."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Cruxophim, Karkas says, "That's what ma
            ol' marm used ta say when I was a lad."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim lifts his jawbone dagger toward the ceiling.&nbsp;
            As he utters a single, sharp phrase invoking the Shadows, a
            bloody silvery grey goat corpse twitches rapidly, then
            explodes, sending little bits of gore everywhere.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Never back up ta a harny goat."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas nods.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium gazes thoughtfully at a carved teak bar.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium pours herself a bright orange ginger-peach cocktail
            rimmed in slivers of candied ginger.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium sniffs at her ginger-peach cocktail.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Mnar says, "We're eating here."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            Thrassus looks rather relaxed.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Thrassus, you say, "You look relaxed."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to you, Karkas says, "They'll ram yar in
            the arse."<br>
            <br>
            You ponder the meaning of Karkas's existence.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera opens her mouth, then closes it again.)<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus says, "It's either that or burning things down."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium flashes a quick grin at Thrassus.<br>
            <br>
            You take a drink from your spiced rum.&nbsp; A touch of
            clove and cinnamon, intermingled with the sharp tastes of
            mint and rum, assaults your palate.<br>
            You feel your nerves loosening as you begin to relax.<br>
            You have 2 quaffs left.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim takes a drink from his ginger-peach cocktail.<br>

            Mnar asks, "So have any more ghosts been discovered?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Thrassus, Xanthium says, "Thanks for the
            alternative."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I saw a ghost today."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He was very nice."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "I got here just before you
            did.&nbsp; They appeared to be a few drinks in."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "So it seems."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "Thus ends my update.&nbsp;
            Oh, save for Juspera having a bruise that looks like Teras."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "No choice but to join them."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar pours himself a glass of spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Cruxophim, Karkas says, "I shur do."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Shurdew."<br>
            <br>
            A coin-wielding rotund broker waves in your direction,
            yelling, "Have you had a chance to admire the landscape
            yet?&nbsp; Truly remarkable!&nbsp; Imagine the coin to be
            made when the population is booming!"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking flirtatiously to a dusky blue-skinned half-krolvin,
            Cruxophim taunts, "See you later, good lookin'."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Tha was tha name a tha lass what ate
            ma leg off."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to a coin-wielding rotund broker, Mnar says,
            "You're delusional."<br>
            <br>
            You glance skeptically at a coin-wielding rotund broker.<br>
            <br>
            You blink at Karkas.<br>

            Speaking to Karkas, you say, "I thought you said it was a
            shark."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium grins at Karkas.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Xanthium says, "You did."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to you, Karkas exclaims, "She was!"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Lass shark."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "A shark lass."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Lubber gets it."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Like a cutlass."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, you ask, "Or do you mean a liss?"<br>
            <br>
            Karkas peers quizzically at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Wait, that's not a word."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily asks, "A who?"<br>
            <br>
            Karkas pours himself a glass of spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium asks, "Lass shark?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium asks, "Oh, you mean like a
            predatory sort?"<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily asks, "Is tha'.... SKIN?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "That's a cougar."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I was thinking maybe he meant liss, because, you
            know, his accent."<br>
            <br>
            You sigh wearily.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "I think that's related but
            different."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking defensively to Karkas, Cruxophim mutters, "Who's
            askin'?"<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Karrrrkas."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Me."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Whoevar tha may be."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "Vocabulary lessons are
            extensive and perverse."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium nods at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar nods at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus asks, "Perverse?"<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim adopts an agreeable expression.<br>
            <br>
            You scratch your head.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Thrassus, Xanthium says, "It's important to
            recognize slang so there aren't misunderstandings."<br>
            <br>
            You take a drink from your spiced rum.&nbsp; A touch of
            clove and cinnamon, intermingled with the sharp tastes of
            mint and rum, assaults your palate.<br>
            You feel tension draining away, giving way to a very relaxed
            state.<br>
            That was the last of it!<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I'm very relaxed."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar whispers, "Ask if he paints nudes."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, you ask, "Do you paint nudes?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Xanthium, Karkas says, "Never trarst a
            fat man wi' yar food."<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Mnar!"<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "No!"<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim presses his paintbrush confidently against the
            easel's canvas using wide strokes.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking amicably to you, Cruxophim mentions, "I can."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, you say, "Mnar told me to ask that."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium looks thoughtfully at Karkas.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Xanthium says, "I'll remember that,
            thanks."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking amusedly to Mnar, Cruxophim ventures, "Would you
            like a nude?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I was asking for a friend."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Mnar, Karkas exclaims, "Strip down,
            lubber!"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Xanthium says, "We already have one
            in the bathroom."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium points at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, you say, "He wants a nude."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Not a painting."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            Mnar looks rather relaxed.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Jus' watch yar wangs aroun tha' one."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking slowly to Xanthium, Cruxophim ventures, "One of....
            Mnars?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "No, we don't have Mnar
            himself in the bathrom, of course it's a painting."<br>
            <br>
            Marijka just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking slowly to Xanthium, Cruxophim ventures, "You have a
            nude of Mnar in your bathroom?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium nods at Cruxophim.<br>
            <br>
            Marijka glances between Cruxophim and Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking pleasantly to Marijka, Cruxophim greets, "Oh hello,
            stranger."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, you ask, "Wait, you have a nude of
            Mnar in the bathroom?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Xanthium says, "Mother brought it
            home."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking suspiciously to Cruxophim, Marijka asks, "Do I want
            to know?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium smiles quietly to herself.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium folds her hands behind her back.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I don't remember sitting for that."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking slowly to Xanthium, Cruxophim mutters, "I feel this
            requires significantly more explanation than you're
            offering."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "Perhaps it was artistic
            license, then, rather than realism."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium appears to be trying hard not to grin.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Marijka, Karkas asks, "Now who be yar?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Must have been..."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            Karkas looks rather relaxed.<br>
            <br>
            You absently say, "You have to depict the wangs correctly."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium laughs!<br>
            <br>
            Mnar worriedly says, "I assume."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Yar do, this is impartant stuffs."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "You should come over
            sometime and critique it, then."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium nods at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim flashes a wide grin.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Marijka, Karkas says, "Ya gots skin tha'
            looks li' sweet candies."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "That seems like an odd sort of decor."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium asks, "I'm not serious.&nbsp; You
            don't blush, do you?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Of course not."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking quickly to Xanthium, you say, "He does."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar tilts his head up.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium says, "Well, I tried."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium takes a drink from her ginger-peach cocktail.<br>
            <br>
            Marijka glances at Karkas.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking curiously to Karkas, Marijka says, "I always
            thought it looked more like... you know... skin."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            Mnar looks rather relaxed.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking pleasantly to Marijka, Cruxophim admits, "In his
            defense, it does look delicious."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim winks at Marijka and flashes a sly grin.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            Mnar looks rather relaxed.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Marijka, Karkas says, "If yar wanna be
            not creative abouts it, yar."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Marijka teases, "Yes, but he hasn't
            earned the right to say such things out loud."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Xanthium asks, "Do you want to eat
            everyone you meet?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking cagily to Xanthium, Cruxophim answers, "No."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim raises his performance portrait proudly,
            displaying it for you to see.<br>
            <br>
            Painted at the top of the canvas, iridescent streamers
            rippled with shadows create suspended motion against the
            wood paneling of the elaborately depicted stage.&nbsp;
            Bedecked in a whimsical witch costume, a dark elven female
            stands mid-stage, her arms outstretched toward a faceless
            audience in the foreground.&nbsp; The model's mouth is
            agape, as if frozen either mid-song or mid-recitation.<br>
            <br>
            You give your eyebrow a little workout.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Um."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "That's very... fanciful."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar applauds.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas grins at Cruxophim.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I could probably do better."<br>
            <br>
            You glance sharply at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim amicably remarks, "Idle doodlings."<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Mnar!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "That's very rude."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim flashes Mnar a toothy grin.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium asks, "You paint people?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar holds up his hand and tilts it side to side in a so-so
            gesture.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking pleasantly to Mnar, Cruxophim requests, "Alright
            now, take yer clothes off?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I dabble."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim offers Xanthium a dark elven performance portrait.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "Would you like it?&nbsp; I
            can give it to Mother if you wish."<br>
            <br>
            You quickly exclaim, "No!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No no, you keep it."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "We can hang it next to Mnar
            in the bathroom."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It suits you."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "...o.. kay..."<br>
            <br>
            Juspera smiles painedly at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            (Mnar tosses his cloak over his shoulder and strikes a
            dramatic pose.)<br>
            <br>
            Speaking gently to you, Cruxophim explains, "I can certainly
            do a better one later, tis just a warm-up to gain
            familiarity with the subject.&nbsp; And its-- her
            ~composition."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Wait."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar drops a glass of spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar slings a slate grey madrinol bone greatbow off from
            over his shoulder.<br>
            <br>
            You chuckle at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim gazes with interest at a small stretched skin
            easel with a sinew-lashed bone frame.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Okay, uh, make it look as though I'm leaping
            through the air, bow drawn and ready to fire."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Here."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar removes a single icy blue arrow from a bundle of icy
            blue arrows.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar starts jumping around like a twelve-year-old.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Marijka, Karkas says, "Yar shoulds try a
            nice drink."<br>
            <br>
            You gaze with interest at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Marijka pours herself a glass of spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Marijka says, "I agree."<br>
            <br>
            Marijka takes a drink from her spiced rum.<br>
            Marijka looks rather relaxed.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            Karkas looks quite relaxed.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium takes a drink from her ginger-peach cocktail.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking affably to Marijka, Cruxophim inquires, "So what
            brings you to these miserable shores?"<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim chuckles.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Marijka, Karkas says, "Well now, yar
            heres an' other falks seems ta knows yar..."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Marijka, Karkas says, "I'm Karkas..."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking rhetorically to Cruxophim, Marijka asks, "What
            motivates me to do anything I ever do?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Marijka, you ask, "...money?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Remember, heroic."<br>
            <br>
            (Karkas glances at his empty hands in amazement.)<br>
            <br>
            Karkas picks up a glass of spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Marijka introduces, "I'm Marijka."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking cagily to Marijka, Cruxophim remarks, "I have some
            ... theories."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim gives Mnar a sidelong glance and curls his lips
            into a lascivious leer.<br>

            A coin-wielding rotund broker waves in your direction,
            yelling, "Have you had a chance to admire the landscape
            yet?&nbsp; Truly remarkable!&nbsp; Imagine the coin to be
            made when the population is booming!"</span></font></p>

            Speaking to you, Marijka admits, "Money's nice.&nbsp; Not my
            primary motivator, though."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "These glasses are gettin smallar."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Marijka, Karkas says, "A far pleasure ta
            be makin yar acquaintanceship."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas pours himself a glass of spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            Karkas looks quite relaxed.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking mildly to Karkas, Marijka says, "You seem far too
            consumed by that pleasure."<br>
            <br>
            You move to stand behind Cruxophim.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Marijka, Karkas says, "Farteen bottles a
            day keeps tha scarvy away."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas winks at Marijka.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Mnar asks, "Does it look heroic yet?"<br>
            <br>
            Karkas takes a drink from his spiced rum.<br>
            Karkas looks quite relaxed.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim winks at you and flashes a sly grin.<br>
            <br>
            You mouth, "Farteen..."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas nods in agreement to you.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, you say, "It's excessively heroic."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Exactly farteen."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar exclaims, "No such thing!"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium chuckles.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas shows you a glass of spiced rum, which he is holding
            in his right hand.&nbsp; You see nothing unusual.<br>
            <br>
            (Cruxophim eyes up the rotund broker hungrily, as if sizing
            up a piece of meat.)<br>
            <br>
            You fidget.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Xanthium asks, "Are you putting his
            kitty in, too?"<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim blinks at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Marijka, you say, "You should try the uh."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim can offer Xanthium only a blank expression.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Marijka, you say, "The..."<br>
            <br>
            On the teak bar:<br>
            other (16): some vanilla punch bowl cake, a tumbler of sloe
            gin garnished with a lime slice and a cherry, a bowl of
            hearty clam chowder, a cup of hazelnut coffee, a fried
            apricot dumpling, a segment of roasted eel, a bright orange
            ginger-peach cocktail rimmed in slivers of candied ginger, a
            few golden brown hushpuppies, some orange and sesame shrimp
            over noodles, some banana leaf-wrapped prawns on a bed of
            minced peppers, a slice of fermented sea pineapple (2), a
            glass of spiced rum, a bowl of spicy lobster soup, a tankard
            of murky brown stout, a rolled coconut-pandan waffle.<br>
            Great Lord Nazarr just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Xanthium says, "...his cat.&nbsp;
            Outside."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium grins at Cruxophim.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera taps the hushpuppies, a confused look on her face.)<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus whispers, "Shrimp with noodles."<br>
            <br>
            You quickly say, "Shrimp with noodles."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Mnar says, "Fried cornbread balls."<br>
            <br>
            You mumble something under your breath.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim raises his half-elven male portrait proudly,
            displaying it for you to see.<br>
            <br>
            Sprawled out across a chaise is the reclined image of a
            half-elven male, his blue-grey eyes turned outward in a
            sultry gaze.&nbsp; Painted across the canvas backdrop are
            rows of stark white candles with brilliant yellow-orange
            flames, the light reflected perfectly in the model's eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim offers you a sultry half-elven male
            portrait.&nbsp; Click ACCEPT to accept the offer or DECLINE
            to decline it.&nbsp; The offer will expire in 30 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim bats his eyelashes.<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Thrassus, "Thanks."<br>
            <br>
            Marijka helps herself to a few golden brown hushpuppies.<br>
            <br>
            You accept Cruxophim's offer and are now holding a sultry
            half-elven male portrait.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Uhm."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Um."<br>
            <br>
            You snicker.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Marijka agrees, "They do look better than
            the rotten pineapple."<br>
            <br>
            A coin-wielding rotund broker waves in your direction,
            yelling, "Have you had a chance to admire the landscape
            yet?&nbsp; Truly remarkable!&nbsp; Imagine the coin to be
            made when the population is booming!"<br>
            <br>
            You glower darkly at a coin-wielding rotund broker.<br>
            <br>
            You turn around.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking loudly to a coin-wielding rotund broker, Cruxophim
            protests, "WE GET IT!"<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim raises his hands toward the sky in surrender!<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Mnar asks, "I'm, uh... did you see
            the bow?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar taps a slate grey madrinol bone greatbow, which is in
            his left hand.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar looks closely at your half-elven male portrait.<br>
            <br>
            You nod slowly at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim flashes Mnar a toothy grin.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking quietly to herself, Marijka murmurs, "Imagine the
            coin to be made when the population is decreased by one
            annoying broker."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium asks, "Are you sure you wouldn't
            rather just be naked?"<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim turns his stretched skin easel to face Karkas.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas wobbles slightly, trying to keep his balance on a
            salt-stained driftwood pegleg.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium shrugs at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking knowingly to Mnar, you say, "The bow's in there."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim bursts out in loud, raucous laughter at you.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas strikes a painting-perfect pose for Cruxophim!<br>
            <br>
            Karkas inhales deeply upon his pipe, puckering his lips and
            sending out two rings of smoke before him briefly.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I just feel, like, the artist took some
            liberties."<br>
            <br>
            (OOC) Xanthium's player whispers to the group, "Mnar's
            portrait looks like a still from a 80s music video."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus smiles quietly to himself.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, you say, "Let's try this."<br>
            <br>
            You turn over your half-elven male portrait.<br>
            <br>
            (OOC) Cruxophim's player whispers to the group,
            "Hahahahaha."<br>
            <br>
            You show Mnar your half-elven male portrait.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, you ask, "Any better upside down?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "...no."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to you, Karkas says, "That's how that do it
            in thar jungles."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Upside down...from thar vines."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, you say, "They..."<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Pose."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "That seems exhausting."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "And dangerous."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Exhausterous."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "I seened it right befar they ate my
            leg off."<br>
            <br>
            You blink at Karkas.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "The sharks?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Always back to the leg."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas nods in agreement to you.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium asks, "I'm a wee bit tired
            myself.&nbsp; Is this a good place to stay the night?"<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Them too."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, you say, "There's a mildewy inn next
            door."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I think this is, in fact, a terrible place to
            spend the night."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus says, "That inn is adequate."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Marijka suggests, "If you drink yourself
            into a stupor, you won't notice the terribleness as you
            slump to the floor."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "At least there's food and
            more of this fruit juice."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium shrugs at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium takes a drink from her ginger-peach cocktail.<br>
            <br>
            You grin.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Oh it's a fine inn, except for the silvery mist
            that comes every few minutes and eats part of your life
            essence."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Mnar, Karkas says, "Tha's just the mist
            off tha ocean."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "But you know the inns in Whenimer's are a bit
            boisterous so really it's the same."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus says, "I find the mist comforting."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They are."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Boisterous."<br>
            <br>
            You nod at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "You act like that's
            unusual for the world.&nbsp; I live just outside the
            Graveyard back home, I bet I won't even notice."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Thrassus, Marijka says, "It's weird, creepy
            mist, so I'm not in the least surprised to hear you say
            that."<br>
            <br>
            Reodin heads over to the Whelk Shell Table.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus says, "Well, it leaves my life force be."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus says, "So I do not mind."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Thrassus, you say, "You're lying."<br>
            <br>
            Hoid just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            Hoid heads over to the Whelk Shell Table.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Its jus a cool breeze far tha night."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus says, "I am not."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "He looks all right to me."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium shrugs at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yeah but so do I."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "And I stare at Thrassus a
            lot."<br>
            <br>
            Kaeredwyn just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            Kaeredwyn heads over to the Whelk Shell Table.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium nods once to you.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at some inviting tables.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Are they having a party in there?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Fine. You stay here tonight, and we'll put up
            the missing posters in the morning."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim flashes Mnar a toothy grin.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "You will not, that's too
            much work."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium grins at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Mnar, Karkas asks, "Who's missin?"<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Xanthium, "You know, we can find you
            someone better."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking idly to Thrassus, Marijka says, "The last time I
            had a good conversation with you, I think you were playing
            scribe for me at the Temple of Koar.&nbsp; It's been
            awhile.&nbsp; That was a good time, though."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Marijka, you say, "Thrassus is a very good
            assistant."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium whispers, "Oh, he doesn't want me, anyway.&nbsp;
            I'm too young."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium glances at Thrassus.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Xanthium, "He doesn't?"<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Xanthium, "Well he should broaden his
            horizons."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium leans over and whispers, "He thinks I'm a baby."<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Xanthium, "I am offended on your
            behalf."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Marijka agrees, "Oh, yes.&nbsp; His...
            scribing... was impeccable."<br>
            <br>

            service adequate."<br>

            him yet?"<br>
            <br>
            You nod at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium glances between Mnar and yourself.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium grins at you.<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Xanthium, "Yes, you can have him."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar furrows his brow.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking absently to Marijka, Cruxophim interjects, "Sorry,
            what?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "If you put up a poster,
            I'm six foot seven.&nbsp; Get my eyes right, too."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "Or I'll come back and
            haunt you."<br>
            <br>

            <br>

            Speaking to Xanthium, you say, "You are at least six foot
            nine."<br>
            <br>
            You tilt your head up.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to you, Karkas says, "Well she ain far foot
            two."<br>

            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "I am so.&nbsp; I mean, at

            Marijka strikes a painting-perfect pose for Cruxophim!<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim dabs the bristles of his paintbrush against his
            easel's palette and begins to paint.<br>
            <br>
            You take a drink from your hearty clam chowder.&nbsp; The
            dissolving chunks of potato lend an extra thickness to the
            chowder, and the chopped bits of clams and celery mix well
            in every bite.<br>
            You have one quaff left.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Marijka emphasizes, "My finger nails."<br>
            <br>
            You pour yourself a bright orange ginger-peach cocktail
            rimmed in slivers of candied ginger.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Marijka, Karkas says, "Yar, thems."<br>
            <br>
            You accept Mnar's offer and are now holding a glass of
            spiced rum.<br>
            <br>
            (Mnar points at Juspera's cocktail, then makes a 'gimme'
            motion with his fingers.)<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Marijka says, "It's a thing you can
            buy."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera glances at the slivers of candied ginger lining the
            cocktail.)<br>
            <br>
            &gt;lick my cock<br>
            You lick your ginger-peach cocktail.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;give cock to mnar<br>
            You offer your ginger-peach cocktail to Mnar, who has 30
            seconds to accept the offer.&nbsp; Click CANCEL to
            prematurely cancel the offer.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar rolls his eyes.<br>

            Mnar has accepted your offer and is now holding a bright
            orange ginger-peach cocktail rimmed in slivers of candied
            ginger.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "Sorry, I had to." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Marijka adds, "Paint, of a sort."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "I see."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar takes a drink from his ginger-peach cocktail.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium nods at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "See?&nbsp; It's tasty."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar nods at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Marijka, Karkas asks, "Think i needs tha
            on ma fingars?"<br>
            <br>
            Karkas wiggles his fingers.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas inhales deeply upon his pipe, puckering his lips and
            sending out a small stream of smoke before him briefly.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Marijka says, "I'm not certain that
            shade would suit you."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Mnar says, "They're essential for the
            modern male."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium pours a few drops of perfume from her fiery amber
            bulb on herself.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, you ask, "Hey can I see that?"<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "I'm receivin mix't messages."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium removes a copper-glazed fiery amber bulb from in
            her dark suede cloak.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas glances between Marijka and Mnar.<br>

            You accept Xanthium's offer and are now holding a
            copper-glazed fiery amber bulb.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium says, "Sure."<br>
            <br>
            You sniff delicately at the fiery amber bulb, and detect the
            faint scent of almond oil and plum blossom with fiery
            cinnamon amber undertones.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Mnar asks, "Well, who do you trust
            more?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, you say, "That's really good."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Isn't it?"<br>
            <br>
            On second thought, that doesn't sound like such a good
            idea.&nbsp; There's no telling what might happen if you pour
            your bulb into the rum.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera puts a couple drops from the amber bulb into the
            rum.)<br>
            <br>
            You offer your fiery amber bulb to Xanthium, who has 30

            in a black are a deep ocean blue?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking helpfully to Karkas, Cruxophim suggests, "Dip your
            fingers in something caustic, they'll turn a lovely shade."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "I wouldn't drink it..."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium has accepted your offer and is now holding a
            copper-glazed fiery amber bulb.<br>
            <br>
            You take a drink from your spiced rum.&nbsp; A touch of
            clove and cinnamon, intermingled with the sharp tastes of
            mint and rum, assaults your palate.<br>
            You have 4 quaffs left.<br>
            <br>
            You ponder.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar gawks at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They both taste like cinnamon."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Mnar, Karkas says, "Likely tha shart
            tempered lass."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Xanthium asks, "What...kind of temper?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Mnar asks, "But wasn't it a lass that
            bit your leg off?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It was a shirk."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas looks over at Mnar and shakes his head.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Shark."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.<br>

            Cruxophim raises his half-elven portrait proudly, displaying
            it for you to see.<br>
            <br>
            Muted golds and browns swirl and blend to create a modest
            backdrop for an enormous gold-inlaid throne set centrally on
            the canvas, a half-elven woman seated regally upon the
            seat.&nbsp; Incredible detail of a mithglin half-plate has
            been flawlessly reproduced, giving the wardrobe an
            exceptional realistic appearance.&nbsp; Faded images of
            notable warriors from history adorn the background, and a
            framed map of Elanthia has been positioned to the right of
            the model.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Xanthium, Karkas says, "And a SHART

            Speaking huskily to Cruxophim, Karkas says, "Yar wangs got
            no meat on em."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, you say, "We admire your accent. It's
            very regal."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "It's so authentic."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Xanthium says, "By most legal systems in
            the world I'm a hathlyn."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium folds her hands behind her back.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Xanthium, Karkas says, "Bless yar."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily asks, "Da yar need a tissue?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Xanthium says, "Not yet."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Xanthium says, "Perhaps if the sharts
            get up to mischief again."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily exclaims, "I'm jus yankin yar harnies!"<br>
            <br>
            Karkas waves his hand in a dismissive gesture.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas holds his sides and lets out a rumbling belly laugh.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium says, "...harnies..."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, you say, "It is very authentic."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Arthentic."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim raises his female portrait proudly, displaying it
            for you to see.<br>
            <br>
            Pools of deep copper dappled with puffs of cream-colored
            paint spill across a dark-paneled wooden floor. With her
            foot raised against a short stool, a white blonde-haired
            woman holds a porcelain teacup outstretched in a toast, a
            wide drunken grin plastered across her face.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Thrassus, Xanthium whispers aloud, "What's a
            harnie?"<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim offers Xanthium a drunken female portrait.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Xanthium, Karkas says, "Li' the wee
            goats.. harny."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Harns."<br>
            <br>
            You mouth, "Harny."<br>
            <br>
            (Karkas pokes his fingers up from either side of his head.)<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Xanthium says, "I'm not that
            soused.&nbsp; This woman nearly has her face in her cup."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Who?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, Mnar says, "License."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium shows you a drunken female portrait, which she is
            holding in her right hand.&nbsp; Pools of deep copper
            dappled with puffs of cream-colored paint spill across a
            dark-paneled wooden floor. With her foot raised against a
            short stool, a white blonde-haired woman holds a porcelain
            teacup outstretched in a toast, a wide drunken grin
            plastered across her face.<br>
            There appears to be something written on it.<br>
            <br>
            You lean forward.<br>
            <br>
            You nod at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily says, "Arkay arkay arkay...I gotta go ta
            bed."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "My license looks pretty
            good, then."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium flashes a quick grin at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, you say, "That is the image you should
            strive to live up to."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Karkas, Xanthium says, "Good night."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking lightly to Karkas, Cruxophim wishes, "Night,
            sharty."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking huskily to Marijka, Karkas says, "Til nex' we meet,
            sweet skin."<br>
            <br>
            Karkas tries to catch Marijka's eye, but she doesn't seem
            very interested.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim bursts out in loud, raucous laughter.<br>
            <br>
            Karkas huskily exclaims, "Farty far!"<br>
            <br>
            Karkas just left.<br>
            <br>
            You bite your lip.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well. He is a... character."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium snickers.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim nods slowly to you.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium says, "...aren't we all."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I'm not."<br>
            <br>
            You take a drink from your spiced rum.<br>
            You feel tension draining away, giving way to a very relaxed
            state.<br>
            That was the last of it!<br>
            <br>
            Marijka suggests, "You could be."<br>
            <br>
            Marijka glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "I could be a character?"<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Are you going to write a book?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Mnar says, "You could be a protagonist."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking lightly to Marijka, Cruxophim encourages, "Oh,
            please do."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking thoughtfully to you, Marijka says, "I'm not a
            writer, but I do take part in stories sometimes."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I could be a propagandist."<br>
            <br>
            You nod at Marijka.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Thrassus says, "You'd make an interesting
            propagandist, indeed."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus nods in agreement.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking thoughtfully to Thrassus, Marijka says, "Do you
            remember that Hunter's Manifesto back when the Spirit of
            Rone was trying so badly to terrorize the Landing?&nbsp; I
            wonder what our propagandist here would think of that."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking fondly to Marijka, Cruxophim muses, "Ahhh,
            Rone.&nbsp; Those were the days."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Marijka, Thrassus says, "She'd find it
            interesting reading."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Hey."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Marijka, you say, "Okay, but wait a second."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Marijka, you ask, "Do you see this bruise on my
            neck?"<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim snickers at a small blood red parchment that
            reads, "Mayor Cruxophim.&nbsp; Death by Rone.&nbsp;
            Fashanos. 5118.".<br>
            <br>
            Marijka glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I have a bruise that looks just like Teras Isle."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim raises his fisherman portrait proudly, displaying
            it for you to see.<br>
            <br>
            An enormous rainbow trout colored in brilliant hues from
            magenta to sunflower yellow dangles on the end of a mithril
            fishing rod held by a dark elven male, his flat black eyes
            fixed on the sapphire blue waters of the picturesque lake in
            the background.&nbsp; A small wooden spit perched over a
            smoldering fire is positioned next to the model, the burning
            flames awaiting an incoming feast.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus accepts Cruxophim's fisherman portrait.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus adopts an agreeable expression.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Thrassus, you say, "Thrassus, that's so manly."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking quietly to Cruxophim, Xanthium suggests, "If you do
            start a series of nudes..."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium glances between Thrassus and Cruxophim.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking sweetly to Xanthium, Cruxophim implies, "Nudes
            cost... extra."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "Your neck is still
            sore-looking."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera tries to look at her neck, drunkenly.)<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Xanthium asks, "I think you've gotten
            paid and then some, haven't you?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium grins at Cruxophim.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking innocently to Xanthium, Cruxophim wonders, "Have
            I?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "How much more than zero?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Everything is much more than zero."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "I'd tend to agree."<br>
            <br>
            You lick your golden brown hushpuppies.&nbsp; Each of the
            hushpuppies is a misshapen golden brown ball of cornmeal and
            flour, seasoned lightly with salt, pepper, and finely minced
            onions.&nbsp; While the exterior is quite crunchy, the
            inside is moist and tender.<br>
            <br>
            You lick your golden brown hushpuppies.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar squints at you.<br>
            <br>
            You defensively say, "I only have one left."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Mnar says, "That's now how you eat those."<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "I'm savoring it!"<br>
            <br>
            You lick your golden brown hushpuppies.&nbsp; Light and
            fried to a rich golden brown, the hushpuppies are perfectly
            salted and seasoned with a light oniony flavor.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "That doesn't look like
            savoring."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking dryly to you, Marijka admonishes, "They will make
            you more, I'm certain of it."<br>
            <br>
            You lick your golden brown hushpuppies.<br>

            inside is moist and tender.<br>
            <br>
            You turn over your golden brown hushpuppies.<br>

            You lick your golden brown hushpuppies.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar pokes you in the ribs.<br>
            <br>
            You take a bite of your golden brown hushpuppies.&nbsp; Each
            of the hushpuppies is a misshapen golden brown ball of
            cornmeal and flour, seasoned lightly with salt, pepper, and
            finely minced onions.&nbsp; While the exterior is quite
            crunchy, the inside is moist and tender.<br>
            That was the last of it!<br>
            <br>
            (OOC) Marijka's player whispers to the group, "Soon we will
            be able to answer the age-old question: How many licks DOES
            it take to get to the center of a hushpuppy?"<br>
            <br>
            (OOC) Xanthium's player whispers to the group, "I don't
            think I've ever had that question."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium pours herself a bright orange ginger-peach cocktail
            rimmed in slivers of candied ginger.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium takes a drink from her ginger-peach cocktail.<br>
            Xanthium looks rather relaxed.<br>
            <br>
            You nod slowly at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, you say, "You should try the ginger on
            the edge."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium asks, "I should lick it, you
            think?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium licks her ginger-peach cocktail.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, you say, "Suck on it."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim bursts out in loud, raucous laughter.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, you say, "Go on, it's good."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar shrugs at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, you say, "It tastes like candy."<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthium stares at Juspera with barely a quirk on her lips,
            and then purses them over the glass' rim, and sucks a little
            of the concoction and the candied ginger.)<br>
            <br>
            You nod approvingly at Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Xanthium says, "Mm.&nbsp; Quite tart."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar applauds Xanthium.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Xanthium, you say, "See? Savoring."<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar removes an aquamarine gem from in his Dhe'nari scout
            cloak.<br>

            Mnar offers Xanthium an aquamarine gem.<br>

            Xanthium accepts Mnar's aquamarine gem.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium glances at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium asks, "Are you giving me rocks for a reason?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Cruxophim, Mnar says, "Tip."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim nods slowly at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Xanthium says, "The first one's free."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthium offers Mnar an aquamarine gem.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Where did my drink go?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Mnar exclaims, "Vanished!"<br>
            <br>

            Thrassus says, "Well, this evening has been entertaining im
            multiple ways, but I believe I must take my rest."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Thrassus, Xanthium says, "Me, too."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I think I'm not far behind."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well maybe I should go to bed too then."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Marijka says, "Careful.&nbsp; Cruxophim has
            plans for you for tonight."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "...like what?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking vaguely to you, Marijka says, "It's a bit of a
            story."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Oh a story?"<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Like a bedtime story?"<br>
            <br>
            Marijka adds, "Much expanation involved."<br>
            <br>
            Marijka nods slowly at Cruxophim.<br>
            <br>
            Marijka agrees, "A bedroom story."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking lewdly to you, Cruxophim purrs, "Oh, very much a
            bedtime story."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking affably to Marijka, Cruxophim echoes, "Bedroom,
            yes."<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "A bedroom story?"<br>
            <br>
            Marijka nods.<br>
            <br>
            Marijka firmly asserts, "Bedroom."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Uh."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Is this, uh, suitable for public telling?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Mnar, Marijka says, "No, you can't come."<br>
            <br>
            You quickly say, "I need to go."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Marijka teases, "To bed?"<br>
            <br>
            You fidget.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            You pick idly at a suede-cushioned stool.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Marijka suggests, "You're looking a bit
            wobbly there.&nbsp; Would you like an escort?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Um."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "No, no, she's fine."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "That's what Mnar's for."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar nods at Marijka.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking brightly to Mnar, Marijka exclaims, "Oh, THAT"s
            what you're for!"<br>
            <br>
            You lightly pat the teak bar.<br>
            <br>
            Marijka adds, "I'd wondered."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar clears his throat.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I'm very versatile."<br>
            <br>
            You absently say, "...that is what he is for..."<br>
            <br>
            You lightly pat the teak bar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "So! Enjoy your evening."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking pleasantly to you, Marijka says, "Well then, I hope
            he serves you well.&nbsp; Try not to stumble over your
            feet."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar nods.<br>
            <br>
            You nod once.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You hang your head.<br>
            <br>
            [Hearthstone, Front Porch - 477]<br>
            Airy and open, the porch is enclosed by smooth, freshly
            painted white modwir up to a height of about four
            feet.&nbsp; As you ponder the sky-blue color of the ceiling
            and a lacework of deep green ivy that crisscrosses the open
            space between posts, the hubbub of the world beyond quickly
            fades away.&nbsp; Rocking chairs of various sizes are an
            inviting sight, and an elegant green marble arch provides a
            tantalizing view of the splendors inside the old
            manor.&nbsp; You also see the porch steps, a scorched oak
            sideboard with some stuff on it, a doorman and a purple
            modwir bin.<br>
            Also here: Elphieya who is sitting<br>
            Obvious paths: none<br>
            <br>
            You curtsy to Elphieya.<br>
            <br>
            Elphieya fans her jade green wings at you, stirring the air
            into a small, focused breeze that swirls about you.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking abruptly to Elphieya, you say, "I might be drunk."<br>
            <br>
            Elphieya blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking tentatively to you, Elphieya asks, "Oh?"<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Where is Mnar?"<br>
            <br>
            Elphieya glances around the area.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            You snap your fingers.<br>
            <br>
            You point at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking vaguely to you, Elphieya says, "Right there."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar flails his arms about.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar joins your group.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking quietly to Mnar, Elphieya asks, "Did you get her
            drunk?"<br>
            <br>
            You nod slowly at Elphieya.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar looks over at Elphieya and shakes his head.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "She did that all by herself."<br>
            <br>
            You nod at Elphieya.<br>
            <br>
            Elphieya glances between Mnar and yourself.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking accusingly to Mnar, you say, "You gave me a drink."<br>
            <br>
            Elphieya lightly says, "Seems you two disagree on that."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar exclaims, "A drink! Out of, like, seven!"<br>
            <br>
            You wave your hand in a dismissive gesture.</span></font></p>
