              for games like truth or dare is that you're not allowed to
              watch without participating; that is, no one gets to see
              someone being vulnerable without also submitting to the
              process. However, this was a long time ago, and I obtained

            [House Brigatta, Common Room]<br>
            The main room of the house is large but cozy.&nbsp; A pair
            of leather settees with matching footstools sit before a
            massive rough-hewn stone fireplace.&nbsp; Along one wall,
            tall bookcases stand alternately with weapons racks, each
            holding a goodly assortment of their proper objects.&nbsp;
            Thickly woven tapestries cover the windows, enhancing the
            room's feelings of privacy and intimacy.&nbsp; You also see
            a small oak counter and a polished rosewood door.<br>
            Also in the room: Celtar, Lady Bloodsnake, Lady Cullien,
            Lord Mnar, Lady Lylia<br>
            Obvious exits: south, east.<br>

            You say, "Mnar, you were never so ripe for the picking."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia whispers, "Ask him if he has any idea how offputting
            his attitude of superiority can be. It's one thing if it's
            done with humor, but really."<br>

            You whisper quietly to Lylia.<br>

            Celtar winks at Lylia.<br>

            Celtar asks, "so how would he know?"<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            You say, "Um..."<br>

            (Juspera presses her fingers to her temples.)<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Go ahead, ask for help."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes, whisper to me while I ponder, people."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Who is Semtexx, and how did he get into the
            rift?"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia whispers, "Ask him to get on the crystal amulet and
            say something preposterous, such as offering to sell his
            body."<br>
            <br>
            .... Hmmph!<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I have no idea."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whis lylia I could do a lot of things like that, but of
            course I'm trying to think of something more sophisticated
            for him.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar nods.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Silvean and I met a Semtexx once. We were not
            amused."<br>
            <br>
            You rub your chin thoughtfully.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia whispers, "Bah, give him something nice and
            humiliating."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia winks at you.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "too bad Shoshonna is not around"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar grins.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia nods to Celtar.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "I can think of a real good one about now in
            regards to her and oh Mustafo"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I have known Shoshonna for years and years; she
            is the greatest such gameswoman I have ever met."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Mnar, you should have taken a question."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Would you prefer I said truth?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Fine, fine, truth, then."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No, that wouldn't have been any easier. I keep
            rejecting suggestions and I'm too tired to think of anything
            good enough for me."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia rubs you gently.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "Long night, hm?"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "the ones Id suggest unfortunatly require some
            folks to be here and unfortunatly or I should say fortunatly
            for Mnar none are about"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Fortunately, I'm the only Dhe'nar awake in the
            Landing, it would seem."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "All right, before I collapse from lack of
            sleep..."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Mnar, can you define a "greatest failure" in your
            life?"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "ahh good question"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Oh, good question."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Greatest failure?"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "aye thats a good question to you"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods to Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes, I figured that would be easier to lay a
            finger on that the typical "greatest embarrassment.""<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "I've had...&nbsp; setbacks, but failures?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's quite possible you've never had what you'd
            consider a failure."<br>
            <br>
            Cullien asks, "Certainly we've all experieced failures?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Well, I have one, but I doubt it will seem like
            such to any of you."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "There is no one alive who has not had what he
            or she considers a failure."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "aye think deep Sho'nah Im sure you can think
            of something"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods to Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "It was not long ago, less than half a year now"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I doubt this question will prove entertaining so
            much as insightful, which is our second goal in this game."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "A friend of mine, the q'hala-who-was-Lexara, had
            been assigned a task by the Warlord"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Oh. Lexara."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "You know the q'hala?"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "ahh the Flach ri G'kna'a requested a task of
            Lexara aye"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia smiles faintly, disdain evident on her features as she
            nods in assent.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I know her, yes."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Mhm."<br>
            <br>
            Cullien fidgets.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Anyways, at the time I was a bit smitten with
            her, and eagerly volunteered to help with her task..&nbsp;
            it hadn't been forbidden"<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "So we went to the Rest and completed a long set
            of exhausting tasks..&nbsp; took most of the evening"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "And when we got back, we met a dwarf named
            Heech."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "The q'hala was--and always has been--rather
            outspoken, and not realizing that this Heech was a spy for
            the Warlord, attempted to hire him to finish the rest of her
            task."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;think I am in the same room with you. That's not the
            same as having me in possession.<br>
            You focus on projecting your thoughts...<br>
            Round time: 5 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar scoffs at you.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;think And why am I thinking to you if we're in the same
            room?<br>
            You focus on projecting your thoughts...<br>
            Round time: 5 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "The conversation with Heech was rather long, and
            during it I told her she shouldn't do that sort of thing,
            and that she was relying on others--such as Heech and I--too
            much"<br>
            <br>
            You see Lord Mnar Akurion the Half-Elf.<br>
            He appears to be in his 60's, has shoulder length, wavy
            golden blond hair, blue eyes, and pale skin.<br>
            He has a tattoo of a white skull on a field of black on his
            neck, and a tattooed symbol of Lorminstra on his forearm.<br>
            He has some minor cuts and bruises on his left arm, some
            minor cuts and bruises on his right leg, minor cuts and
            bruises on his chest, minor cuts and bruises on his
            abdominal area, and some minor cuts and bruises on his right
            arm.<br>
            He has developed slurred speech.<br>
            He is holding a long black metal staff in his right hand.<br>
            He is wearing a gold ring, a dark leather Dhe'nari scout
            cloak, some dark spidersilk breeches, a shadowy black
            weapons harness, a burnished leather ankle sheath, an onyx
            kitten pendant, a golden key cloak clasp, a vultite wall
            shield, a pair of mithril alloy bracers, a translucent glaes
            spider charm, a gold-threaded dark leather pack, a pin that
            reads 'Protect her!? Ya gotta be kidding!', a black onyx
            wolf charm, an ogre tooth necklace, and a crystal amulet.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "The next evening the Warlord and Highpriestess
            summoned the q'hala to them for a private discussion."<br>
            <br>
            A pained expression crosses Celtar's face.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "They were displeased."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia nods.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "a costly error of the q'hala Im sure."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "And equally displeased with me, who they felt
            she had manipulated into helping her."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "As punishment, she was stripped naked, and sent
            to Icemule--after I severed her leg at the hip--for a
            month."<br>
            <br>
            A pained expression crosses Celtar's face.<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia smiles.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Her tongue was also removed, but that was the
            Warlord's doing, not mine."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia clasps her hand over her mouth.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia clears her throat.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "to mar beauty was never one of my favorite
            tactics"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar nods.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "though the tongue Im sure Id not miss"<br>
            <br>
            (Lylia appears to be biting her lip to keep from chuckling.)<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "ok I might"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar coughs.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "It was a grueling time for her."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Unable to speak, accept help, or use anything
            she didn't earn by herself."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "My failure was that I was unable to prevent it."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar asks, "and did you pay too?"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar peers quizzically at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I am sorry you took that as your failing and
            not hers, Mnar."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "Does she still live?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I paid as well."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "That's a different story."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "Dead, is she?"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "She survived."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I saw her last night."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "And is stronger from the experience, I'd say."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Mm. Such a tragedy it all is."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Right, that was nothing if not... er, sobering...
            but there's more than one purpose to this game."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I told you I'm no fun."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Ah, but now it is your turn."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes, so we see that fun isn't everything."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia smiles at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Lylia."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Fun is hardly the reason for being for
            everyone...however, it has its place."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Truth! Gods, truth, please."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I do not want to ask men if they find me
            attractive while nude."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I think Puris is a bit sleepy too."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Oh, Puris is in?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Ah, Puris then."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "he's here you cant sit in and not "sit in""<br>
            <br>
            Lylia snaps her fingers.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Right, Puris it is. I defer."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia smiles at Puris.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Perhaps later, Lylia."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Puris."<br>
            <br>
            Cullien gazes heavenward.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Your choice?"<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "I shall go wit Truth"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Mm, four in a row now.&nbsp; For the record, I
            wanted a dare."<br>
            <br>
            Cullien says, "That could still be arranged Mnar"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "I tried."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "and it was quite enjoyable I think I just
            attracted a new crop of lasses"</span></font></p>

            Lylia begins chuckling at Celtar.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "I'm afraid I'm not too good at this..&nbsp;
            suggestions, anyone?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes, sex questions are tacky but provide a base

            Mnar says, "Hm..&nbsp; No, too base."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar frowns.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Those high standards getting in your way too,
            Mnar?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Always."<br>
            <br>
            You grin.<br>

            Mnar says, "No one's offered a suggestion yet."<br>

            Mnar scowls.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Base, schmase. One who is secure in her
            position never has to worry about looking too crass."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia smiles.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Why ask a pointless question, Lylia?"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "The point is for humorous intent. Sometime when
            you're older, I'll explain humor to you."<br>

            <br>
            Lylia narrows her eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Cullien blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "has been an elf I would have to say in my case
            yes."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia exclaims, "Because you are the ONLY man in creation
            who can deliver a compliment and have it be received as a
            slap!"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar raises an eyebrow in Lylia's direction.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar chuckles.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar winces.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "Great Koar, do you realize how you seem? Why
            people would rather hide than talk to you?"<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "I seem to be more attracted to elven women."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gazes heavenward.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "You do not, do you?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Lylia, you're stealing Puris's moment."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "You really don't know...poor innocent."<br>
            <br>
            Puris shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Hm. Forgive me, Puris."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Goodnight, all."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "You're much more fluent when you're drunk,
            Lylia."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia shifts her eyes to Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            (Celtar pats Puris on the back.)<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "At least, did you consider those compliments?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Personally, I didn't, but perhaps I didn't
            'understand' them."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "you came late and we have been indeed drinking
            a bit too much as you can tell."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods to Puris.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "No. I considered them as I believe they were
            intended."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia put a glass of fine white wine on a small oak counter.<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "now if only I could figure out dat elven tounge
            so I know what dey say about me."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "Then there is nothing to say."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I am sober and right-minded."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia smiles at Puris.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I'll tell you sometime."<br>
            <br>
            Cullien begins chuckling at Puris.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "you dont want to know"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia winks at Puris.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar winks at Puris.<br>
            <br>
            Cullien is admiring Puris.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            (Lylia leans over and whispers something in Puris's ear.)<br>
            <br>
            Mnar put a long black metal staff in his Dhe'nari scout
            cloak.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "This is your house, Lylia, so I'll leave
            instead."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar nods to Celtar.<br>
            <br>
            Lord Mnar just went south.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Excellent suggestion."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia sneers.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Arrogant whoreson jackanapes, rotton get of a
            rolton and a kobold with the red rot...."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia paces back and forth.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He's... I enjoy him."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "oh now those were well said"<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "he is gone"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "Why!? In the gods' name, why!?"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia exclaims, "He insults me every time he sees me!"<br>
            <br>
            Cullien says, "Beacuse there always must be one, lylia"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "Does he think I have no feelings? No pride? No
            dignity!?"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia scowls.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "I love a woman who can insult like there is no
            tomorrow."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I resent that."<br>
            <br>
            Cullien gazes heavenward.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar winks at Cullien.<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "maybe he has a crush on ya"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Ah, Lylia, think of the boy who sat behind you in
            school, always pulling your hair."<br>
            <br>
            You nod to Puris.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia sighs.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He's most definitely in love with you."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Would a simple discussion that---"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods to Puris.<br>
            <br>
            Cullien furrows her brow.<br>
            <br>
            (Lylia looks completely nonplussed.)<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "I always pick on those who I..."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "He what!?"<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "want"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well, I wouldn't mention it in front of him now."<br>
            <br>
            You look at Lylia and shake your head.<br>
            <br>
            Cullien blushes a nice shade of off-pink.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "Then why does he treat me badly? Does he not
            see? Does he not know?"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia peers quizzically at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Pretend I never said anything."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "What can he say?"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia exclaims, "I don't stand for that. I cannot stand for
            that. He insults me!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "You're so... untouchable."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia exclaims, "He could talk to me as an ordinary person!"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia peers quizzically at you.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I'm married, not made of marble."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "Id not stand for it if I was you"<br>
            <br>
            Puris shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods to Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's his only way of approaching that pedestal he
            sees you on..."<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "never inject common sense to a man in love"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I am not at all unapproachable or distant.
            I'm...well, as sorceresses go, I'm cuddly."<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "it don't work"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia wrinkles her nose.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Never let on I said that."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia mutters under her breath.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I'm so sorry, Puris. I did just talk right over
            you."<br>
            <br>
            Cullien says, "At the very least, Lylia...you are always
            civil"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It won't leave the room."<br>
            <br>
            Puris chuckles.<br>
            <br>
            Puris shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia smiles apologetically.<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "life goes on."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "No, it was rude. I do hate being rude when I
            don't mean to be."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Lylia, he loves you the only way he knows how."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "Juspera, where did you get this mad, mad idea
            that...?"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "Dhe'nar love is harsh love."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Impossible."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia raises an eyebrow in Celtar's direction.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Surely not that harsh."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well, he insults you all the time... that can mean
            three things."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "One, that he hates you."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "It means just that! He hates me. He resents me.
            He does not like me."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "aye but sadly m'lady..."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar leans back.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar sighs sadly.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Two, that he's just teasing you but is a total
            fool about it."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Three, that he's infatuated with you."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia exclaims, "Well...do something!"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia flails her arms about.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Knowing Mnar, I think we can discount one and
            two."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I mean...talk to him. Straighten. Fix.
            Correct."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            (Lylia drums her fingernails on the counter.)<br>
            <br>
            Lylia sighs.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "And here I have gone and done a wretched
            thing."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia bites her lip.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well, Lylia, I don't know Silvean well, but you
            might consider giving Mnar what he wants, just one night...
            you know... that'd change him."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "spurned love from he who probably spends every
            waking thought thinking of you."<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods to Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia's jaw drops.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "No."<br>
            <br>
            Puris starts chuckling at you!<br>
            <br>
            Cullien blinks.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "No?"<br>
            <br>
            Cullien says, "heavens"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "it would indeed be heaven Im sure."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar winks at Cullien.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar glances at Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "You do not understand. I am married to Silvean.
            Only Silvean. He is...he is all there is to me as men go."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "Id swear that some days&nbsp; Silvean glows
            and I know why."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar grins.<br>
            <br>
            (Lylia darts a quick glance at Celtar and smiles
            fleetingly.)<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Silvean and I are married."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well, I didn't say Silvean couldn't be a part of
            it too."<br>
            <br>
            You shrug.<br>
            <br>
            Puris cringes.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "well you know it could be a good test of your
            love for Silvean"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods to Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Of course, that's up to him."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "That is like trying to overfill a full cup. It
            would just make a mess."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar furrows his brow.<br>
            <br>
            Cullien coughs.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "love can indeed be messy"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar winks at Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And I don't even know if Mnar would take well to
            sharing his moment with you with Silvean."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I do not want to, is the main thing."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "You assume he wants a 'moment.'"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well, no."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He wants a lifetime."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But a moment may suffice..."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "With m..."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia coughs.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "Me?"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "Dhe'nar tend to"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "You must be mistaken."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "If only to show him that you aren't what he really
            wants."<br>
            <br>
            You frown at Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I know this is a shock."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I'm sorry, everyone makes mistakes, but you
            must be mistaken."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But... let youself be flattered by it."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia paces back and forth.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "Shock?"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar waves his hand in a dismissive gesture.<br>
            <br>
            Cullien says, "ooof....I am not at all sure Mnar wants this
            at all at all"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "what you fine ladies should be doing is
            searching the realms high and low for a mate for me."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar nods.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I'll say. I thought he loathed me. He was
            always needling me."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Celtar, there she sits."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia glances at Cullien.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia winks.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia nods to Cullien.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar smiles at Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            (Cullien stares into her drink.)<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Exactly! Exactly so! I do not think he wants
            that at all."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's his only way to deal with that intense
            emotion over you."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "But regardless, I may have offended someone who
            does not deserve my offense."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar asks, "fortune gazing using the drink?"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar cocks his head at Cullien.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "The only intense emotion he feels, I am sure,
            is distaste."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He knows he cannot have you in love... so he will
            have you in hate."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But that's not what he wants."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "But I do not like to hate people."<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "either way it gets your attention."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Lylia, be generous. Show him you understand."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Lust? The only man I have ever lusted for---and
            how---I always treat with courtesy and utmost respect."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "be generous now thats a loaded statement"<br>
            <br>
            Celtar grins.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia shifts her eyes to Celtar.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar coughs.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar fidgets.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I can be a little generous. I just don't think
            it's applicable in this case."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar bows to Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "my parden you know me."<br>
            <br>
            Cullien nods to Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia smiles at Celtar.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Yes, well enough."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia winks at Celtar.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "Well, where is he?"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gestures and utters a phrase of magic.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia wrings her hands.<br>
            <br>
            Puris shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            Celtar frowns.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He already puts you high up on a pedestal... take
            advantage of it. Tell him you know how he feels and that you
            care about him."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "ahh play his heart strings aye"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "This is madness, though, what you speak."<br>
            <br>
            Cullien nods to Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Of course it is... but it's real."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I will apologize for having misinterpreted his
            disdain as something personal. That is all."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia bites her lip.<br>
            <br>
            Cullien gives a sigh of relief.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Be generous..."<br>
            <br>
            Celtar says, "you could wrap his heart strings around your
            finger and play them like a mandolin."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gestures and utters a phrase of magic.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gestures into the air.<br>
            Lylia momentarily gets a faroff look in her eyes, and then
            returns to normal.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well, she could."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Celtar, I do not like to play men. I used to,
            but when I married, I set aside old hobbies for new."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gestures and utters a phrase of magic.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "I should be off. He's in the courtyard."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia sighs.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "What a fret this all is."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia mutters under her breath.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Remember... be generous."<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gestures.<br>
            Lylia becomes blurred, and then vanishes!<br>
            <br>
            You throw your head back and howl!<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera gives Celtar a high-five.)<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "yer both evil"<br>
            <br>
            Puris chuckles.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Poor Lylia."<br>
            <br>
            (Celtar grins at Juspera.)<br>
            <br>
            You grin.<br>
            <br>
            You whistle tunelessly to yourself, remembering days past.<br>
            <br>
            Cullien gazes heavenward.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Heck, poor Mnar."<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "we should have gone to watch"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Puris, come sit on mama's lap."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera pats her lap.)<br>
            <br>
            Puris says, "I too big for ya"<br>
            <br>
            You scowl at Puris.</span></font></p>
