Welcome to your home for GemStone III guides, logs, humor and original work.
I'm J (not Juspera, as the title would seem to indicate; Juspera has been
seen in the Landing).
<P ALIGN=Left>
There are few graphics here apart from the counter and shameless Simutronics
plug at the bottom, so the pages load quickly. This site's probably best
viewed with Netscape. I do not put anything up on this site that I do not
believe is worthwhile. The majority of my material is original and unable
to be found anywhere else (unless someone steals it). I didn't want this
site to be a collection of other people's maps, guides and stories; I wanted
it to stand alone.
<P ALIGN=Left>
I try to update the site every week (I aim for Sundays). New items will be
shown in <FONT COLOR="#0080c0">yellow </FONT>on their pages for at least
a week, whenever feasible. Notes from the 2006 move will be shown in
<FONT COLOR="#0080c0">green</FONT>.

<P ALIGN=Left>
So here we are. I've had broadband for a couple years now, but never got
rid of my old AOL account -- because of the 200+ web pages stored on it.
I knew if I was going to go to the trouble of moving them all, I'd want to
take that time to go through each page and correct errors, update links,
add notes, and change the color settings. And that was a job I wasn't looking
forward to. But apparently I was right to procrastinate; so much time has
passed by now, it's actually fun to read over all the old pages once more.
<P ALIGN=Left>
I will keep this page as it is, until I return to playing and updating regularly
once more... if such a day ever comes to pass. I would like the name of the
site to remain as it is in perpetuity. It's grown into itself; when the site
was new, I named it "Good Ole" with slight irony, since the page was brand
new. But the name was meant as a nod to the site's emphasis on roleplaying
(which matched the values of many of the day's old-timers, whether or not
their nostalgia for the Ice Age was accurate) and on content over
flash&nbsp;(which harkened back to the earliest days of websites). When the
game made the move from GS3 to GS4, of course, the name seemed a bit silly.
But it no longer does -- the site has lived so long now without significant
change that it really does refer to an earlier time, and the name is no longer
ironic at all. Imagine my pleasure at finding my junk turn into an antique,
through careful lack of effort on my part. It's almost like I planned it.
