            Also here: Siwas, Anteb, Fleckle, Lady Aramana, Setzier<br>
            Obvious exits: out<br>
            <br>
            You rub your chin thoughtfully.<br>
            <br>
            On the small shelf you see a dagger sheath, a small sack and
            a velvet pouch.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Velvet pouch."<br>
            <br>
            A sales clerk steps over to you and says, "Ah, a fine choice
            madam.&nbsp; The velvet pouch sells for 35 silvers.&nbsp;
            You can BUY the velvet pouch if you like."<br>
            <br>
            A sales clerk accepts your silvers.<br>
            A sales clerk makes a quick trip to a back storage area and
            returns with a velvet pouch.&nbsp; Handing it to you
            carefully, a sales clerk says, "Here's your pouch.&nbsp;
            Hope you enjoy it."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "See if she likes this."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier's group just went east.<br>
            [Icemule Trace, East Road]<br>
            Crowds of adventurers flock along this main road, traveling
            back and forth between the East Gate and the Icemule town
            center.&nbsp; Young children run around, tugging at
            travellers' coattails as they hawk cheap gems.&nbsp; A
            rather squat wooden building sits comfortably on the north
            side of the road.&nbsp; You also see Marigold.<br>
            Also here: Siwas, Anteb, Fleckle, Lady Aramana, Setzier<br>
            Obvious paths: east, west<br>
            <br>
            &gt;give pou to mar<br>
            The Marigold ignores your offer.<br>
            <br>
            You sigh.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;ask marig about fabric<br>
            Marigold adjusts her spectacles, then nods vigorously, "Yes
            yes.&nbsp; I can use that!&nbsp; You have it to give me
            yes?"<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera dangles the pouch in front of Marigold.)<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Maybe we need tattered cloth or something."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;ask marig about pouch<br>
            Marigold adjusts her spectacles, then shrugs her thin
            shoulders,&nbsp; "Is not something I know.&nbsp; P'haps you
            could ask one of the fair brawny adventurers hangin' about
            the town?"<br>
            <br>
            &gt;l marig<br>
            Marigold is a female halfling whose diminutive size is made
            more evident by her stooped posture.&nbsp; The skirt and
            cuffs of the dress that she wears are frayed at the edges,
            and the garment appears to have torn in several places. The
            rips, however, have been carefully mended with bright green
            squares of fabric, fancifully embroidered with orange
            marigolds.&nbsp; She has a large brown satchel slung over
            one shoulder and a white apron tied about her waist. Deep
            wrinkles crease the edges of her bright brown eyes, and
            wispy tendrils of curly grey hair frame her face.<br>
            <br>
            Fleckle says, "Thats what I was thinking."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Ask her about cloth.. she says she needs it.."<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "We can check the tables for empty boxes..." to
            your group.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;ask marig about cloth<br>
            Marigold adjusts her spectacles, then nods vigorously, "Yes
            yes.&nbsp; I can use that!&nbsp; You have it to give me
            yes?"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier rubs his chin thoughtfully.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "And the pawnshop..." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Aramana whispers to the group, "Or ask on the amunet."<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "People will take them out of boxes and drop
            them there to sell the empty box" to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "And if all else fales, there's a shop that
            sells bolts of cloth in Solhaven." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Fleckle says, "We can destroy orcs or thyrils until we find
            some."<br>
            <br>
            Aramana whispers to the group, "There's a place in Solhaven
            "<br>
            <br>
            Aramana chuckles.<br>
            <br>
            Aramana grins at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I'll check for trash."<br>
            <br>
            You give your pin a little tap.<br>
            Aramana's pin flashes a Shiny Yellow color.<br>
            Siwas's pin flashes a Shiny Yellow color.<br>
            Fleckle's pin flashes a Shiny Yellow color.<br>
            Setzier's pin flashes a Shiny Yellow color.<br>
            Your pin suddenly flashes a Shiny Yellow color.<br>
            Anteb's pin flashes a Shiny Yellow color.<br>
            You sense 5 other teammates adventuring in the lands.<br>
            <br>
            You head over to the Hoot Owl Table.<br>
            [Hoot Owl Table]<br>
            This table is shaped like an hourglass, except that one end
            has a wider flare than the other.&nbsp; This arrangement
            allows for additional chairs to be placed, which makes this
            table popular with larger crowds.&nbsp; You also see an
            iron-bound tanik box.<br>
            Obvious exits: out<br>
            <br>
            You carefully begin to examine an iron-bound tanik box for
            traps...<br>
            <br>
            You discover no traps.<br>
            Roundtime: 16 sec.<br>
            <br>
            You remove a diamond-edged black vaalin lockpick from in
            your cloak.<br>
            <br>
            You settle into the difficult task of picking the lock.<br>
            You make a poor attempt (d100=36).<br>
            You struggle with the box.&nbsp; As you do, you get a sense
            that the box has a tricky lock (-240 thief-lingo difficulty
            ranking).&nbsp; Then...CLICK!&nbsp; It opens!<br>
            <br>
            In the tanik box you see a filthy yellow overcoat and some
            silver coins.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;think I found a filthy yellow overcoat.<br>
            You project your thoughts out to all of your teammates...<br>
            <br>
            [Icemule Trace, East Road]<br>
            Crowds of adventurers flock along this main road, traveling
            back and forth between the East Gate and the Icemule town
            center.&nbsp; Young children run around, tugging at
            travellers' coattails as they hawk cheap gems.&nbsp; A
            rather squat wooden building sits comfortably on the north
            side of the road.&nbsp; You also see a velvet pouch, a
            gyrfalcon and Marigold.<br>
            Also here: Siwas, Anteb, Lady Aramana, Setzier<br>
            Obvious paths: east, west<br>
            <br>
            You hand Marigold a filthy yellow overcoat.<br>
            Marigold beams at you as she tucks the overcoat into her
            satchel.<br>
            With a little wink, she pulls a cloth from the pocket of her
            apron and places it in your hand.<br>
            <br>
            You let out a cheer!<br>
            <br>
            Setzier blinks at you.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier scowls at you.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Do we each need one?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Let's find more clothing."<br>
            <br>
            Marigold sinks slowly to the ground, tucks her shawl snugly
            around her shoulders, then promptly falls asleep.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Not sure."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Do you want one?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Maybe the bench."<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You join Setzier.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier's group just went west.<br>
            [Icemule Trace, Town Center]<br>
            The bustling town comes together in this square.&nbsp;
            Halflings dressed in varying fashions stand about, some
            chattering happily, others reclining on cloaks laid on the
            ground.&nbsp; One ancient halfling leans against the base of
            the large ice statue of a mule, snoring blissfully.&nbsp; A
            feeling of community pervades the area, putting you
            immediately at ease.&nbsp; You also see a wooden shield, the
            Brandewynn disk, some acantha leaf, some ambrominas leaf,
            some woth flower, some torban leaf, some haphip root, some

            You rub your chin thoughtfully.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Maybe we don't all need one."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Somebody like lichen?"<br>
            <br>

            <br>

            A low, dense, cold fog blankets everything.&nbsp; In some
            places a halfling could walk with only his or her head
            sticking above the eerie fog.<br>

            [Magical Burrow, Old Workshop]<br>
            The swirls of fog outside the grime-encrusted window fill
            the room with an eerie light.&nbsp; A robed skeleton lies
            slumped over a workbench littered with the trade of a
            crystal artisan.&nbsp; In the center of the room stands a
            small forge, its fires long since cold.&nbsp; A family of
            mice has made its home in the rotted velvet upholstery of a
            long seat once used for waiting customers.&nbsp; You also
            see a circular brass stand with a large crystal ball on it.<br>

            Siwas just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            You glance down to see a soft white cloth in your right hand
            and nothing in your left hand.<br>
            <br>
            You wave your white cloth around.<br>
            <br>
            You rub your white cloth over the crystal ball.<br>
            <br>
            An odd tingling sensation spreads through your fingers and
            up your arm, then suddenly, you are yanked off your feet and
            into a thick, swirling fog!<br>
            <br>
            Damp misty fingers clutch and pull at you, dragging you
            deeper into the cloudy mass, then suddenly drop you to the
            ground!<br>
            <br>
            The fog flows away from you like a cat fleeing into the
            night.<br>

            [Krolvin Warship, Main Deck]<br>
            The deck of the ship is empty and silent save for the
            creaking of the hull as it rolls on the waves.&nbsp; Looking
            out over the water, a fleet of warships fills the bay,
            rolling in lopsided unison.&nbsp; Screeching seagulls are
            visible through the ratlines as they circle and swoop over
            the ships.&nbsp; You also see a single wooden dinghy
            attached to the port-side of the ship.<br>

            <br>
            The initials "T.D." are intricately embroidered in black

            You ask, "So how'd you all find clothing?"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier asks, "So which way.&nbsp; ratlines, or the dinghy?"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "Bought it."<br>

            Setzier begins chuckling at Aramana!<br>

            Aramana tightens her grip on her white cloth.<br>

            Siwas nods to Setzier.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier's group went through a single wooden dinghy attached
            to the port-side of the ship.<br>
            [Darkstone Bay, Wooden Dinghy]<br>
            The swells rock the small dinghy in rhythm with the bay,
            causing the oars to clatter in their oarlocks.&nbsp; A light
            breeze brings the smell of salt and sea life across the
            boat.&nbsp; Overhead, seagulls and other ocean birds dive
            and swoop, filling the air with their raucous calls.&nbsp; A
            sandy beach lies a short distance away.<br>

            Aramana just tried to pull a pair of oars.<br>
            <br>
            Aramana seems to be trying to figure out how to turn a pair
            of oars.<br>

            <br>
            Siwas yawns.<br>
            <br>
            Aramana grabs the oars and rows swiftly towards the shore.<br>
            <br>
            Aramana picks up the oars, then realizing you're already at
            the shore, drops them again.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier glances at Aramana.<br>
            <br>
            [Darkstone Bay, Wooden Dinghy]<br>
            The dinghy rocks slightly as the surf pushes it against the
            shore.&nbsp; In the distance, the din of a fierce battle can
            be heard and smoke can be seen rising from the west.<br>

            The shore extends into a small, sandy promontory that juts
            into Darkstone Bay.&nbsp; In the distance, a fleet of
            Krolvin warships lie at anchor.&nbsp; To the west, this path

            Rows of dinghies are tied up on this sandy stretch of
            beach.&nbsp; To the south, you can see smoke rising from the

            The jagged shoreline of the bay becomes more evident here
            along the path as the cool waters of the Bay rush up almost
            to your feet.&nbsp; The sounds of a great battle can be

            <br>
            Aramana gestures.<br>
            A translucent sphere forms around Aramana.<br>
            <br>
            You shift your weight.<br>
            <br>
            You glance down to see a soft white cloth in your right hand
            and nothing in your left hand.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "This could hurt."<br>
            <br>
            You wave your white cloth around.<br>
            <br>
            Aramana says, "Stupid cloth."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "Use the cloth as a shield."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier smirks.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Maybe they'll think we're waving white flags."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier starts chuckling at you!<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Maybe."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier asks, "Ready?"<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Though I refuse to surrender to a Krolvin."<br>
            <br>
            Fleckle says, "I hate krolvin, and even though Talbot was a
            halfling..."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They would do horrible things to you."<br>
            <br>
            Fleckle says, "This is going to be great."<br>
            <br>
            Fleckle grins.<br>

            Setzier's group just went southwest.<br>
            [Wehnimer's, Exterior]<br>
            You can hear the noisy sounds of a fierce battle around the
            land gates to the west.&nbsp; Occasionally, a Krolvin
            warrior looks around menacingly as he makes his way towards
            the gates.&nbsp; Over the din, you can just barely hear the
            sound of the surf from the northeast.<br>
            Also here: Siwas, Lady Aramana, Fleckle, Setzier<br>
            Obvious paths: west, northeast<br>

            You exclaim, "Look!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I don't think he saw us."<br>

            Setzier's group just went west.<br>
            [Wehnimer's, Outside Gate]<br>
            Armor-clad fighters and light-footed rangers jostle against
            you before the great wooden gates of Wehnimer's
            Landing.&nbsp; Harried guards and militiamen clash swords
            with a snarling horde of Krolvin warriors.&nbsp; Dust,
            screams and the oily smells of blood and sweat fill the air
            around this large trading post.&nbsp; A dirt path encircling
            the wooden palisade of the town leads off to the east and
            southwest.&nbsp; You also see a large wooden barrel.<br>
            Also here: Siwas, Lady Aramana, Fleckle, Setzier<br>

            You say, "Ooh."<br>

            Siwas traces a sign while beseeching the spirits for

            I could not find what you were referring to.<br>

            A krolvin warfarer swings a falchion at a sinewy dwarven
            sorceress!<br>
            A direct hit!<br>
            The sorceress crumples to the ground.<br>

            The guard crumples to the ground.<br>

            Setzier says, "I don't think we're really here."<br>
            <br>
            You grimace.<br>
            <br>
            A krolvin warfarer suddenly trots into view!<br>

            A krolvin mercenary swings a broadsword at a gaunt human

            The rogue crumples to the ground.<br>

            The guard crumples to the ground.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Where's the hero?"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier searches around for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas points at a wooden gate.<br>
            <br>
            A krolvin warfarer swings a falchion at a red-haired dwarven
            mercenary!<br>
            Falchion clashes with banded shield!<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "Can't go in it."<br>
            <br>
            The krolvin mercenary looks a little dubious about its
            situation.<br>
            <br>
            A krolvin warrior stirs groggily.<br>
            <br>
            Fleckle says, "Behind it..."<br>
            <br>
            Fleckle says, "In the small space."<br>
            <br>
            Fleckle smiles.<br>
            <br>
            A krolvin warfarer barks some odd sounds.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier rubs his chin thoughtfully.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas searches around for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier's group went through a small space.<br>
            [Wehnimer's, Behind Barrel]<br>
            This tiny space between the barrel and the wooden palisade
            affords a brief protection from the fighting.&nbsp; Leaning
            against the wall is a battle-clad halfling trying to staunch
            the bleeding from a wound in his leg.<br>
            Also here: Lady Aramana, Fleckle, Setzier<br>
            Obvious paths: out<br>

            Siwas just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas joins Setzier's group.<br>
            <br>
            Fleckle says, "I love this tale."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier blinks.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            You shiver.<br>
            <br>
            The earth shakes violently as a large explosion reverberates
            through the area<br>
            <br>
            Setzier groans.<br>
            <br>
            Aramana says, "Bloody."<br>

            Setzier says, "He's dieing."<br>

            Aramana stands up.<br>
            <br>
            The small man is clad in full battle armor.&nbsp; He
            grimaces in pain as he tries unsuccessfully to staunch a
            large gaping wound on his right leg, the blood spilling
            through his fingers and onto the dirt.<br>

            Setzier says, "Perhaps we're the ones who save him, to kill

            Setzier glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            The halfling looks out beyond the barrel the barrel with a
            worried look, then goes back to trying to tend his wound.<br>
            <br>
            Fleckle says, "He can't see us."<br>

            (Juspera bounces lightly on the balls of her feet.)<br>

            You exclaim, "This is so exciting!"<br>
            <br>
            Fleckle says, "No, he's going to do it soon."<br>

            <br>
            "My handkerchief!" he exclaims.&nbsp; He snatches it up and
            quickly binds his leg with it.&nbsp; Swallowing some acantha
            leaf, the little warrior leaps from behind the barrel and
            runs into the battle.<br>
            <br>
            Shortly after, you hear a deep scream of anquish, followed
            quickly by a much higher pitched one.&nbsp; You run out and
            see the body of a huge krolvin and next to it the body of
            the little warrior with a cloth around his leg and a
            broadsword in his chest.<br>

            The swirls of fog outside the grime-encrusted window fill
            the room with an eerie light.&nbsp; A robed skeleton lies
            slumped over a workbench littered with the trade of a
            crystal artisan.&nbsp; In the center of the room stands a
            small forge, its fires long since cold.&nbsp; A family of
            mice has made its home in the rotted velvet upholstery of a
            long seat once used for waiting customers.&nbsp; You also
            see a circular brass stand with a large crystal ball on it.<br>

            deeper into the cloudy mass, then suddenly drop you to the
            ground!<br>
            <br>
            The fog flows away from you like a cat fleeing into the
            night.<br>
