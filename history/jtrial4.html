            Cappurnicus asks, "Defense... you have your witnesses
            prepared?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I do."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Very well.&nbsp; Go on..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I call Xanthias to the stand."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles at Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias takes a deep breath.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Atoyoz shifts her weight.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias moves to stand next to Cappurnicus, starts to sit
            down, and then stands back up, waiting for Prospera.)<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus smiles at Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera clears her throat.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera stretches.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias bites his lip.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera strides over to stand before Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera says, "Xanthias, raise your right hand, please."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias raises his hand.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera asks, "Do you swear on the integrity of this court
            to tell the truth?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "I do, ma'am."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera nods.<br>
            <br>
            (Prospera resumes her place.)<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias sits down.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles at Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias fidgets.<br>
            <br>
            <a name="xanthias1"></a>Ysharra says, "Xanthias, you're one
            of the victims, of these charges."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "I... you could put it zat vay, I suppose."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Yet you've chosen to appear as my-that is,
            the defense's witness."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Yes, ma'am."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Could you tell the court why that is?"<br>
            <br>
            Tebon furrows his brow.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas calmly says, "Objection.. Xanthias was to be called as
            my witness, but time did not permit it."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "I, ah, vas also to be called by Lady
            Ysharra, I sought."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias acts puzzled.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Withdrawn."<br>
            <br>
            Atoyoz stares at Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas shakes her head.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Time constraints restricted that."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "You will have your chance."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Counselor knows this."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias clears his throat.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Anyvay, ah..."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Time was indeed, a large factor."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I could say the same of Vonka and Jacina, but
            I did not."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "As I said, withdrawn."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Zat night, miss Juspera seemed fery much
            unlike how I had efer seen her before."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas smiles almost pleasantly at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka nods to Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "How so?&nbsp; She was different?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Agitated, disturbed, 'not all zere' as you
            might say."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Did she say anything to give you that
            impression?"<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika writes, her hand following the flow of the words she
            hears.)<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Vell, she didn't answer my qvestions... she
            didn't respond as you'd sink one might vhen being spoken
            to."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "You mean, she wasn't really...conversing?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "And vhen she spoke... it... it didn't seem
            as if she spoke to me, necessarily."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Muttering, you think?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas narrows her eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Not speaking to you?"<br>
            <br>
            You shift your weight.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "She vas speaking, ja, but it seemed as if
            not to me."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol slowly empties his lungs.<br>
            <br>
            Atoyoz breathes almost without making a sound.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Did she wait for a response?&nbsp; Or did you
            try to answer, anyway?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "She... she didn't really ask me anysing, and
            her responses to my repeated qvestions vere..."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias furrows his brow.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Hard to understand, I would imagine.&nbsp;
            Since you were confused already."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "almost incoherent, and didn't seem to
            follow, ah, vhat little shred of a confersation zere vas."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Did she repeat herself?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Yes, ma'am."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Yes, yes she did."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Now, thinking back."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Has Juspera ever targeted you for such a
            thing, before?&nbsp; On a milder scale, of course."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Or were you just in 'the wrong place', as
            well?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Not... physically... I mean, she has teased
            me before."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What would she say?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Vell..."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias clears his throat.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias blushes a nice shade of rosy pink.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles at Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika appears to be trying hard not to grin.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "She, ah..."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias shifts his weight.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;l in hav<br>
            In the cotton haversack you see a gold-inlaid grey mithril
            book, a greyish-blue scale-embossed book, an eye-shaped
            sapphire, a few branches, an eye-shaped emerald, some
            multicolored chalk, some fish food, an old crone doll, a
            small snake, a three-eyed halibut, a velvety black rose, a
            mottled flame-hued rose, a long gnarled slugstick, a fancy
            pink bandana, a metal three, a metal three, a cerulean
            star-embossed manual, an eye-shaped ruby, a blue sapphire
            and a sky-blue glaes scarab.<br>
            <i>(WTF? I'm full of shit.)</i><br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "She seemed to sink at times zat I vasn't, ah
            'manly' enough."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias tilts his head down.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias bites his lip.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias tilts his head up.<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire examines her fingernails.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "She had zis, ah, pink bandana she used to
            mock me vis."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Thank you.&nbsp; But it seemed like
            something...just light-hearted banter, eh?"<br>
            <br>
            Vonka furrows her brow.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Your cheeks take on a slightly flushed tone.<br>
            <br>
            Fremie snickers.<br>
            <br>
            Evelith folds her arms over her chest.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Ja, she likes to joke.&nbsp; It nefer
            seemed... openly malicious, if zat's vhat you mean."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Did she describe what she thought of you, at
            all?"<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne sighs softly.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias asks, "At ze time of ze assault?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "At any time."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Anything that she said would be of assistance
            to the jury."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Vell, she sought I, ah, needed to be more
            'forceful.'"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Did she say things like that often?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "To you, or to other people in your presence?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias shifts his weight.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Er... yes, on seferal occasions."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Friends, people on the street, whomever."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar folds his arms over his chest.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You think she targetted people."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Who she thought weren't forceful?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias looks lost in thought.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus smirks.<br>
            <br>
            You shift your weight.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Has this increased over the past few months?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "I hafen't had many run-ins vis her in ze
            past few mons, I'm afraid."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "But she, ah..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Go on."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "I hafe seen her, and heard of her, mocking
            helpless people."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "We have to keep it to what you've seen, I'm
            afraid."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And for the sake of time, I think I'll call
            an end to my questioning, save for one last bit."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Do you think she meant to do it?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias bites his lip.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus furrows his brow.<br>
            <br>
            (Alisaire glances down at her gloved fingers again, limply
            turning her hand over.)<br>
            <br>
            Evelith glances at Alisaire.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Calls for speculation."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Objection."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "I..."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias gulps.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias glances at Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas glances at Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias falls silent.)<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias glances at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "I will have to agree."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Well.&nbsp; That she seemed in control."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas smiles.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias looks over at Ysharra and shakes his head.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ysh If he's about to say yes, maybe it's better the
            objection is sustained.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ysh Ah, there we go.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "She seemed... fery unlike I'd efer seen her
            before."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles at Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Thank you, Xanthias."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Not fully avare of her... surrounding."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias coughs.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "surroundings."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers, "Ah well."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Extremely agitated, sveating, shaking,"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers, "They can ask all the assumption questions
            they like, but I can't."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas fidgets.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Not herself."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ysh Koar will see. He will know.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>

            Xanthias nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Not in control."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "Objection..."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Not vhat I knew of her, no."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Thank you, Xanthias."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Defense, that's enough."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "Asking for mental state of the defendant."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Your witness."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "I don't believe Xanthias is a trained
            empath."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas shakes her head.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "It is done."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias slowly empties his lungs.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra sits down.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Proceed, prosecution."<br>
            <br>

            <a name="xanthias2"></a>Siwas says, "Xanthias, on the night
            of the 26th, did Juspera attack you? Just reconfirm this for
            me."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Physically attacked you and injured you."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Ah, er... yes."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Is it true that she drew a knife and tried to
            stab you?"<br>
            <br>
            Lecea leans forward.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas peers quizzically at Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Um... yes, she tried to stab me, but her
            mental state, fortunately, casued ze blow to be
            ineffectife."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Or, at least zat's ze vay it seemeed."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias clears his throat.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "You have no way of knowing that."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Please just answer what I ask, without
            elaboration."<br>

            Siwas says, "She tried to stab you."<br>

            Xanthias says, "She drew a knife and srust it at me, yess."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "What really stopped that blade from finding
            your flesh? Don't you wear your armor commonly about the
            city?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Yes, but it just glanced off.&nbsp; She just
            srust right at my chest."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias knocks on a battered red eahnor breastplate.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Right at your chest. Indicate where, please?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias just touched a battered red eahnor breastplate.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Er... around here somevhere."<br>
            <br>
            You frown.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera opens her mouth again, but glances at Prospera and
            closes it.)<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias taps himself on the chest.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers, "Later."<br>

            &gt;whi ysh I don't... I wouldn't... that's not something
            I'd do.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers, "We have to move quickly."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "I see."<br>
            <br>
            You sigh.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "If that strike had been true, you'd likely have
            punctured your lung."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "That would have been a painful, unpleasant
            death.. good thing you did have your armor on."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "But it wasn't."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Mmm, or gone under my ribs."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "So this is...more speculation?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "The defendant was unable to kill you."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods to Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Hardly, Ysharra.. I am a trained empath."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "As any member of my guild will tell you."<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol whispers to the group, "She's not giving testimony
            as an expert witness..."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "She could hafe, if she had aimed elsevhere."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You're not the witness, though."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas waves her hand in a dismissive gesture.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Xanthias, have you ever seen Juspera act like
            this before?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Ever seen her attack anyone else?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias furrows his brow.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Not physically, like zat, no, ma'am."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Ever heard Juspera talk about attacking anyone
            else?"<br>

            Ysharra says, "Hearsay."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "It's... it's possible.&nbsp; I mean, ve'fe
            hunted togezer.&nbsp; Fought in defense togezer."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "I heard she..."<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias swallows noisily.)<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Hearing about something is his
            experience."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "But not what he saw."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Corect."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Which is what we are trying.&nbsp; What he
            witnessed."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "You said that you heard Juspera talking to
            'herself', correct? That nobody else was in the room?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Vell, she vas speaking to someone, but it
            didn't seem like me."<br>

            Gahread glances at Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread glances at a light scroll.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "But you say there was someone else there that
            she was speaking to?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "A physical presence?"<br>
            <br>
            Prospera glances at Gahread.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "I didn't see, hear, or feel anyone."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "He already said there was no one there, I
            believe."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "But he has no way of knowing that, Ysharra."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Xanthias has no way of detecting someone who
            may have been invisibly in the room."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Zen again, my attention vas razer occupied
            by miss Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Do you?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas peers quizzically at Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "True."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias looks over at Siwas and shakes his head.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "No, Sivas."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "So someone else could have been there all
            along."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "no further questions."<br>

            Xanthias clears his throat.<br>

            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Xanthias, please take your seat."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias stands up.<br>

            (Mekthros moves to the podium, standing behind it quietly.)<br>
            <br>

            Prospera strides over to stand before Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire leans forward.<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros strides before the witness seat.)<br>
            <br>
            Prospera says, "Mekthros, raise your right hand, please."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros raises his hand.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi capp Okay... the prosecution's witnesses took 2
            hours... should we allow the defense's up to 2 hours for

            to tell the truth?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "I do."<br>

            Prospera nods.<br>

            Xanthias blinks at Siwas.<br>

            &gt;whi capp It'll make the trial go up to a full hour over,

            Alisaire offers Siwas a flask of sandfire liquor.<br>

            Mekthros sits down.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus whispers, "I say we go for numbers or time,
            whichever is faster."<br>

            Maimara stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas sips gingerly at her drink, setting it across the
            table from her afterwards.)<br>

            Siwas winces.<br>

            victim this night in question, yes?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "I was."<br>

            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "That is correct."<br>

            Ysharra asks, "Why is that?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "I would assume it is because of my
            association with Lord Sheru."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Mekthros.<br>

            Ysharra asks, "So that would mean that Juspera...targetted
            people on both sides of the war, wouldn't it?"<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>

            shall be brief..."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "I lured Juspera with promises of her
            having an opportunity to injure me into her cave.&nbsp; She
            took my entreaties well, and said she desired to harm
            someone."<br>

            Genivie glances about with a disgusted look on her face.<br>

            You feel the blood drain from your face.<br>

            Mekthros clearly says, "The night Maimara stated that
            Juspera was possessed, I felt something... extraordinary
            about her person."<br>

            Ysharra asks, "Had you ever seen anything like it before?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "It felt very strongly like a guiding
            force, though none made mention of such a thing and on later
            inquiry, stated they saw none of it."<br>

            the talisman's core and follow the path of her fingertips.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "Prior to the night of the
            possession, I had indeed seen such things in the workings of
            nightmares."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "They unearth the inner desires of

            suede book.<br>

            Siwas tersely asks, "Therefore I say that no, I do not think
            he is an expert witness. A candle casts a shadow, is that of
            Draezir as well?"<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros folds his hands in his lap, watching Juspera with
            a fixed gaze.)<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "It is opinion, nonetheless."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Mekthros is not on trial for his religion, or
            his marks."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ysh Dunno if you'll be allowed Revalos, it may
            depend on how fast this goes, unfortunately.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "He is, however, a witness, for Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread quietly says, "We are establishing his credentials
            as an expert witness."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Fine.&nbsp; Mekthros, how long have you
            served Sheru?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I was attempting to be brief."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ysh It'll remain in the jury's minds whether or not
            it's overruled.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "The court cannot discern religious
            affirmation."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "No, but the witness can."<br>
            <br>
            Genivie leans forward and rests her chin in her hand, a
            thoughtful expression on her face.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It is his affiliation and life."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "I am currently two hundred and three
            years of age.&nbsp; I have served him since my fifty-second
            year."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Unless he's being accused as lying..."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus folds his arms over his chest.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros cocks his head.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros looks thoughtfully at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles at Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Do we need more?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I'm sure Mekthros could keep going."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "I am going to have to stop this line of
            questioning... you have established what you needed to,
            regarding what Mekthros experienced on the night in
            question."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "But like I said...I was trying to sum up."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I'm finished."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Very well."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Your witness, Siwas."<br>
            <br>

            Ysharra smiles at Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Gahread, would you please?"<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Prosecution, continue."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread nods.<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas nods in Mekthros's direction.)<br>
            <br>

            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>

            <br>

            <br>

            ever confirmed you in any position in the Order?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers, "I'm trying really hard to go fast."<br>
            <br>

            Mekthros clearly says, "No."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers, "Thanks."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread asks, "Have you ever met Draezir and spoken with
            him?"<br>

            Ysharra whispers to the group, "I've been told I won't have
            time for anyone but Revalos and Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "During the time that the city of
            Solhaven was blessed with his presence, I witnessed his
            workings on many of the residents there."<br>
            <br>

            Gahread smiles at Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "Juspera was paid frequent attention
            to due to her tendency to insult him."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "This makes...for very bad
            news, for us.&nbsp; I really needed someone to give evidence
            about the tortures besides Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol whispers to the group, "It would help if someone
            could bring up the point about Juspera's hand exploding, a
            Draezir trademark, to make the connection."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "I actually was privileged with the same.
            Amazing that he visited such an honor on a Dhe'nar..."<br>

            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow in Gahread's direction.<br>

            Gahread asks, "Have you had any DIRECT encounters with
            Draezir, Mekthros?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "Yes."<br>

            Gahread asks, "During that time in Solhaven?"<br>

            Mekthros clearly says, "Yes."<br>

            Gahread asks, "Did he acknowledge you?"<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika toys absentmindedly with her quill for a moment,
            then settles herself back to the task.)<br>

            Mekthros clearly says, "Yes."<br>

            follower of Sheru, if he actually does have some high
            position that would make him an expert on nightmares and the
            methods of using them."<br>

            <br>
            Gahread asks, "Did you state anything to her of Juspera's
            motives that night?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros smiles at Jacina, noting her signet band.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "I am afraid I do not recall."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread smiles at Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina glances at Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "Memory is a fickle thing,
            sometimes."<br>
            <br>
            Jacina mutters quietly.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Convenient."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas stares at Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread cheerfully says, "It is indeed. Let me help you."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Overseer, please remind Mekthros that he is
            under oath?"<br>
            <br>
            Gahread asks, "Do you recall telling her anything about
            Juspera needing to hurt people, Mekthros?"<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Do answer the questions in truth,
            Mekthros."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "He said that when we first begain."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi capp Mekthros's been up there for half an hour now,
            15 minutes from each side. <br>
            You whisper quietly to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "I never lie.&nbsp; And yes, she does
            have a need to hurt people."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "I am asking about a specific conversation,
            and I do have a point."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "He did.&nbsp; He stated that Juspera needed
            to hurt people."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "I have mentioned this to... various
            individuals."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread nods to Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Your honor, I request that we get to it."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "It is quite possible I said as much
            to Jacina."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I have other witnesses and very little time."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread asks, "Do you recall asking or demanding that Jacina
            tell you of how she felt?"<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus furrows his brow.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "Oh yes."<br>
            <br>
            Jacina stares off into space.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros looks thoughtfully at Jacina.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "Yes, indeed."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros finds a loose thread on his hooded cloak and snaps
            it off with a quick jerk.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra sighs.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "Interesting. I'll leave the jury to draw
            their own conclusions about Mekthros's decision to revisit
            Jacina."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne slowly empties her lungs.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "It's because the Sheruvians have their dirty
            fingers all over this little incident!" to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra grins at you.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread asks, "Mekthros, did you report Juspera's pulling of
            your nails to any member of the prosecution?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros surveys the area.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "No."<br>
            <br>
            Rinika frowns.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika idly scrawls something on a page in her soft blue
            suede book.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol whispers to the group, "I wish I could
            testify.&nbsp; But I doubt I'd even do much good, with the
            insanity of 'procedure'."<br>
            <br>
            You hear someone mutter burn.<br>
            You hear someone mutter juspera.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles at Quinstol.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas gestures while calling upon the lesser spirits for
            aid...<br>
            <br>
            Siwas gestures.<br>
            Nothing seems to happen.<br>
            <br>
            Fremie searches around for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera frowns.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the voice of Kinshack say, "That was not me."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra makes a nearly imperceptible motion while whispering
            a soft phrase...<br>
            Ysharra gestures.<br>
            A sudden burst of bright light emanates from Ysharra's hand!<br>
            <br>
            Prospera makes a quick gesture while calling upon the powers
            of the elements...<br>
            Prospera gestures.<br>
            Prospera appears to be keenly aware of her surroundings.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            You sense that you are not a wizard and thank your lucky
            stars.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera says, "Kinshack, stay in the open please."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread confusedly says, "We did receive word of the other
            three incidents that night, by the Resistance members... as
            the Council for the defense said, it's interesting that the
            sole Alliance member did not come forward."<br>
            <br>
            Prospera frowns.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera nods.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika mutter something in halfling, only for her ears to
            hear.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "As I understand it, the defendant herself was
            the one who brought this to court."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And it was up to us, as the litigators, to
            meet with those who were injured."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "At least, that's how it was explained to me."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus asks, "Counsel, do you have any other relevant
            questions for this witness?"<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow in Gahread's direction.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas glances at Gahread.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros smiles slightly, leaning back, watching Gahread.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "Testimonials by the other three were
            provided. By this one... well, this is the first I've heard
            of it. But I suppose that's a fault of the trial system,
            certainly not by deliberate design of the witness."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera holds up three fingers.)<br>
            <br>
            Gahread asks, "Mekthros, did you resist Juspera when she was
            pulling your nails out?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "No."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread ponders.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi capp I am only being tried on three counts of
            assault. That is all this court has been convened to decide.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread asks, "Did you wish to resist her?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "This is ridiculous."<br>
            <br>
            (Alisaire slumps back in her chair.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros smiles slightly.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros clearly says, "No."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "He needs to hurry."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "Hardly something that could be termed an
            assault then."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne whispers to the group, "No kiddin'!"<br>
            <br>
            Gahread glances at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "No further questions."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "She is only being tried on three counts,
            Counselor."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Very well."<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "Whew." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas stares at Gahread.<br>
            <br>
            Achillea says, "hardly a victim if he enjoys such things."<br>
            <br>
            Achillea smirks.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Mekthros, please return to your seat."<br>
            <br>
            Achillea clasps her hand over her mouth.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra glances at Achillea.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread sits down.<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros rises quietly.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros stands up.<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas whispers intently with Gahread, a bit agitated.)<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Defense, please call your next witness."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros moves to stand behind Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I call Revalos Lykanderon."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus shakes his head.<br>
            <br>
            (Alisaire glances from Mekthros to Gahread and back again in
            mild amusement.)<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "They look upset." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Revalos stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra turns to face Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles at Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "As well they should
            be.&nbsp; Jacina paid for Gahread's queries."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Please take the stand."<br>
            <br>
            Prospera strides over to stand before Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            (Revalos strides towards the stand.)<br>
            <br>
            Revalos turns around.<br>
            <br>
            Revalos turns to face Prospera.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera says, "Raise your right hand please."<br>
            <br>
            Revalos raises his hand.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera asks, "Do you swear by the integrity of this court
            to tell the truth?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "I also got out of answering
            whether I am on official business or not."<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika stretches a bit and straighten herself in attempt to
            renew her vigor at the task.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "Which was a rather pleasant
            surprise."<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "I do."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera nods.<br>
            <br>
            (Prospera once again returns to her spot near the podium.)<br>
            <br>
            Revalos sits down.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles at Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros nods.<br>
            <br>
            <a name="revalos1"></a>Ysharra says, "Revalos, I suppose
            we'd better tell folks why you're here."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Please do."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Otherwise, you'll have to hear the same
            question about a million different ways, too."<br>
            <br>
            Revalos nods.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What happened to you, during the siege on
            Solhaven?"<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Sum as briefly as you can, please."<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire places her hand on her shadowy crystal talisman.<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "I believe you are referring to what happened
            to me before the siege."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Yes, just prior to the occupation."<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "I encountered a beast of shadow which had
            been plaguing the nights and storms in Solhaven.&nbsp; I was
            attacked and injured by this beast."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire watches Revalos in breathless anticipation.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "You were injured?"<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "I had my legs removed."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Savage, yes."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "They'd attacked other people as well, right?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "And a...kitten, I think?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Objection, how is this relevant to what Juspera
            did on the night of the 26th?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I will illustrate."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Yes, please get to it."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Your honor, with all due respect..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I have been very patient, I think."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You had some aftereffects, I believe."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "to put it mildly"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What happened to you?"<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "that, I can't be sure of, all I know is that
            I became connected with the beast in some fashion."<br>
            <br>
            (Alisaire sits up in her chair a bit.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Connected...it was with you?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Part of you?"<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "I would say the reverse."<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "I was part of it."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "In what manner of relationship?"<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "I saw what it saw, I felt what it felt."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "If you could use one word, to sum that up."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What would it be?"<br>
            <br>
            (Vonka whispers softly, "Ennty.")<br>
            <br>
            (Alisaire watches Revalos intently.)<br>
            <br>
            Revalos clenches his fist.<br>
            <br>
            (Revalos glances at his fist, and slowly unclenches it.)<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "Malice"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It wanted to cause pain."<br>
            <br>
            Rinika idly scrawls something on a page in her soft blue
            suede book.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika looks thoughtfully at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "How did it go about this?"<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "it chose a heartbeat, and it took it away."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It killed."<br>
            <br>
            Revalos nods.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "But...not alone, right?"<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "I do not understand the question"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "During that time...it was with you."<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire quietly says, "You are not familiar with them,
            Ysharra.&nbsp; Don't speculate."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra glances at Alisaire.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika idly scrawls something on a page in her soft blue
            suede book.<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire smirks.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Ali'shara, silence."<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire stares at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias smiles quietly to himself.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Prospera.<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "There was a time, that I was not
            involved.&nbsp; I saw remotely what took place."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "But they used your body."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You were present during the killings."<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "However..." Revalos trails off, then
            continues, "There was a time it was me, with my hands.""<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire snorts at Prospera.<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire just went out.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Where you saw them use your body?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "You mean?"<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus shifts his weight.<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "I did not see it use my body, I only found
            the blood on myself when I was released from the haze"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Now...could you...just give us a brief detail
            as to the nature of these crimes?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What state were the bodies left in?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Objection again on irrelevancy.. the shadows
            that haunted Solhaven were destroyed. Those that remain are
            imprisoned in a bit of crystal and silver, and this happened
            long before Juspera's rampage."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas begins to twitch.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow in Ysharra's direction.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I'm establishing a history of motive."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus asks, "For whom?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Outside manipulation by greater forces."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread quietly says, "Maybe we should put Revalos on trial
            instead..."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas gazes heavenward.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I will lead to my point."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire came through an ash wood arch.<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire stares at Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And I will say again, that I think I have
            been more than agreeable when it was not my turn."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire grips her shadowy crystal talisman a little
            tighter.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Fine.&nbsp; Disregard that, and just tell me
            this, Revalos."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "This goes for everyone.&nbsp; I expect a
            more professional outlook from all.&nbsp; Defense,
            continue."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Who commanded those shadows?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "The ones that bound to you, used your body to
            kill?"<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "Draezir."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ysh That may do it.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You were released from them."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "And did you ever come under trial, here in
            Solhaven?"<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "no."<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra ponders.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias looks thoughtfully at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I think that's all, Revalos."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Thank you."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ysh Groovy.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Your witness, Siwas."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread strides over to stand before Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods to Gahread.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ysh Let's hope Siwas does the cross, she wants to go
            to bed. Oh, dear.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ysh Let's hope she makes it clear to Gahread she
            wants to go to bed...<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Gahread.<br>
            <br>
            Revalos turns to face Gahread.<br>
            <br>
            <a name="revalos2"></a>Gahread asks, "Revalos, when you were
            being used by these shadows, how much of those events do you
            remember?"<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "the majority."<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "although my vision was occluded several
            times."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "But you just said that you did not see it use
            your body... you only found the blood on yourself when you
            were released from the haze."<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "I think I remember most of what happened that
            night. Right? Except... sometimes I only saw red." to your
            group.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread asks, "How can you say you remember the majority of
            those events?"<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "Is that good?" to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "that is correct."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "That's...to be expected."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "Revalos, since you are under oath, I will
            restate my question to make it simpler..."<br>
            <br>
            Revalos nods to Gahread.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread asks, "When you were attacking others, under the
            possession of those shadows, how much of those events did
            you recall afterwards?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra folds her arms over her chest.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Siwas touch your mind:<br>
            "I can hardly wait to cross-examine you, you know."<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "in the final engagements, the shadow and my
            being were one and the same.&nbsp; I felt the quickening
            pulse, the rush, the warmth of the blood.&nbsp; I felt it
            all.&nbsp; And I nearly lost my mind."<br>
            <br>
            You take a deep breath.<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "it makes it hard to forget."<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "That, that, I felt that." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol slowly empties his lungs.<br>
            <br>
            (Revalos stares blankly into the audience.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "I know you did.&nbsp; And
            you will have your turn."<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire buries her face in her hands.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread confusedly asks, "I'm having a very hard time
            comprehending this. I usually consider myself intelligent,
            but I can't reconcile these statements. If you didn't see it
            use your body and only found the blood on yourself when you
            were released, how could you have felt all of it?"<br>
            <br>
            (Jacina glances at Alisaire from the corner of her eye.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika slowly scratches her forehead, her expression
            clearly showing confusion.)<br>
            <br>
            Revalos says, "if you believe that you have a hard time
            comprehending it, you are not alone.&nbsp; I do not as
            well.&nbsp; Yet they did occur."<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "Nice response." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread nods to Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire sits down.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "No further questions."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            You tremble.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread sits down.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Revalos, you have my thanks."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Thank you Revalos."<br>
            <br>
            Revalos stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Revalos.<br>
            <br>
            Revalos nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            (Revalos strides towards the bench he was seated at
            originally.)<br>
            <br>
            Revalos turns around.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus asks, "Defense, have you another witness?"<br>
            <br>
            Revalos sits down.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "In the interests of time, I release two of my
            witnesses from their duty."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I have one last person to call."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne sighs.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Juspera Spintari.&nbsp; Take the stand."<br>
            <br>
            Jacina tightens her grip on her ivory silk handkerchief.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow in your direction.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You stand back up.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            You stride a few steps forward.<br>
            <br>
            You turn around.<br>
            <br>
            You raise your hand.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Prospera.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas appears to be lost in thought.<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Everyone, I know it's been a long
            night.&nbsp; We've all tried to go quickly."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I do. I do."<br>
            <br>
            Prospera says, "Juspera, do you swear by the integ.."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I do."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera nods.<br>
            <br>
            You sit down.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Finish the oath, please."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Prospera.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera clears her throat.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias watches Juspera closely.)<br>
            <br>
            Prospera asks, "Juspera, do you swear by the integrity of
            this court to tell the truth, nothing but the truth and the
            whole truth?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I do."<br>
            <br>
            Prospera nods.<br>
            <br>
            (Prospera returns to her post.)<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera tilts her head up and mouths something at the
            ceiling.)<br>
            <br>
            Atoyoz grins wryly.<br>
            <br>
            You think to yourself, "For you."<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Quinstol touch your mind:<br>
            "Relax... it'll be okay."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Very well..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles at you.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol smiles at you.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Defense, proceed."<br>
            <br>
            <a name="juspera1"></a>Ysharra asks, "Let's cut to the
            quick, shall we?"<br>
            <br>
            You fidget.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Juspera, did you willfully injure these three
            people?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "On the night of the 26th?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias bites his lip.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Perigourd starts chortling.<br>
            <br>
            Atoyoz smirks.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Was there any hesitation?"<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Sort of... I wanted Maimara."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I didn't want to hurt the other people."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Why did you want Maimara?"<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera flushes a little.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Go on."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I was angry."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias blinks at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "All those months, everything that happened,
            everything we did... and no piece."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Why?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Wait, wait."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne sighs.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I couldn't--"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "All these months."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Give me an example, Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            You shift your weight.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "All that time in the EN."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Everything that happened, that made you so
            angry."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra shakes her head.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Specifically."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Tell me about what happened to you, to make
            you so angry?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I tried to do so much. I helped build that fort,
            fought in the invasion, did spying for the resistance."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I gave up so much."<br>
            <br>
            You bite your lip.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias blinks at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I remember you telling me about that.&nbsp;
            You had a lot of resistance within the resistance over it,
            as I recall."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What did you give up, Juspera?"<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow in your direction.<br>
            <br>
            Achillea rolls her eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "You need only answer truthfully."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I could've... things could have been different...
            all the time, they were hurting me, and..."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They promised me things if I'd go over..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "They were hurting you?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Who is they?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Or I could have just bowed out and none of it
            would have happened."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "The Alliance."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas examines her fingernails.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias leans back.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias folds his arms over his chest.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "So the Alliance targetted you
            for...punishment?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "For... revenge."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas gets an odd look on her face for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias glances at Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And...you said they were promising you..."<br>
            <br>
            You breathe in slightly.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Promising you things so you'd...do what,
            exactly?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "Careful."<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas glances back at Xanthias, looking a little surprised
            herself.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They just wanted me to give in and stop fighting."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros slowly empties his lungs.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias returns his gaze to Juspera, trying to keep it
            even.)<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela folds her arms over her chest, glancing at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "They wanted you to surrender, give in...and
            join?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Not to join really. But to stop fighting with the
            resistance. And to bow before their gods."<br>
            <br>
            You clear your throat.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And when you say Dark Alliance..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Do you mean the followers, alone?"<br>
            <br>
            Poor baby!<br>
            <br>
            You quietly say, "No."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Name the followers."<br>
            <br>
            You take a deep breath.<br>
            <br>
            (Jacina strokes Vonka's hair.)<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Objection."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Irrelevant."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "You, Rekarth, Sepher, Siwas, Angelrise, Pyrocite,
            Setzier, Armaxis, Maimara, Mekthros..."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera claps her mouth shut.)<br>
            <br>
            Siwas glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus asks, "Defense, what purpose does this serve?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I'd say the steps down this road are very
            relevant."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "She said that she was angry because of what
            happened."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus asks, "Do you mind elaborating?"<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire looks thoughtfully at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It's been my job all along to establish why
            and how she came to lose control."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I think it's important to know who was a part
            of that."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "No less so than my questioning about Draezir,
            correct?"<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Very well... but remain focused on your
            job."<br>
            <br>
            (Ysharra lifts her hands again, making a dismissive
            gesture.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I am trying, your honor."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Continue."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I'll change the subject, slightly."<br>
            <br>
            You tilt your head up.<br>
            <br>
            You think to yourself, "Keep me strong."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Juspera, who made a promise to you?"<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol whispers to the group, "What does he think, that
            Ysharra wants to expose members of the Dark Alliance as
            targets for the resistance, or something?"<br>
            <br>
            You feel the blood drain from your face.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "More than one... but Eryael, him, he made the
            biggest."<br>
            <br>
            You clear your throat.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas mutters something better left unheard.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas folds her arms over her chest.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What did he want to give you?"<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas leans back in her seat.)<br>
            <br>
            You close your eyes for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Just rest."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias grits his teeth.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He said my rest was coming. He promised."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles at you.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;rgam get sil pet in sat<br>
            You remove a soft rose petal from your fishnet satchel and
            feel confident that no one has noticed your doing so.<br>
            Roundtime: 2 sec.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera furrows her brow.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "He came to you after we did, right?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Before I was hurt. And after."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "When we'd injured you."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "When we'd tortured you."<br>
            <br>
            You slowly and deliberately empty your filled lungs.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "While you were trying to stay true to the
            resistance."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yeah."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And promised you solace."<br>
            <br>
            You bite your lip.<br>
            <br>
            You quietly say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas leans forward.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "That sounds like a good deal of pressure,
            Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Why did he sound so appealing?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Objection, leading."<br>
            <br>
            You feel the blood drain from your face.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He--"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Why not just tell him to leave you alone?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He didn't, I wanted to kill him."<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "I did!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But..."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Hold."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros smiles slightly.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It's hardly leading to ask for her opinion on
            her own stress level."<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol mutters under his breath.<br>
            <br>
            Genivie shakes her head.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "You're telling her how she feels."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Er. Felt."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Juspera is the one person very able to judge
            her state of mind."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "You think a person being tortured and
            fighting in a war wouldn't be?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Withdrawn."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas waves her hand in a dismissive gesture.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Her state of mind, yes... but you needn't
            lead her so."<br>
            <br>
            You take a deep breath.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I know how I felt."<br>
            <br>
            You idly scratch your nose.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus smirks.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Siwas touch your mind:<br>
            "I'll just drive my points home when I get the chance to
            stand where she is right now, that's all."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Answer my other question, please."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Why didn't you just tell him no?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I did, but..."<br>
            <br>
            You grimace.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I couldn't, couldn't, I couldn't forget about
            him."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Something else happened?"<br>
            <br>
            Poor baby!<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I knew what he is. I know what he is. But he
            promised rest."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias looks at you with concern.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Juspera..."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And I was so tired."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What's that in your hand?"<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at a soft rose petal.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra points at you.<br>
            <br>
            Achillea glares with disgust at you.<br>
            <br>
            You put a soft rose petal in your fishnet satchel.<br>
            <br>
            You dust off your hands.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina gasps.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus smirks.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne gazes heavenward.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina clasps her hand over her mouth.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas exclaims, "I knew you still had--!"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas clasps her hand over her mouth.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera sinks down in her chair, a little color touching
            her cheeks again.)<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Er. Pardon."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Contain yourself."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros smiles slightly.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias gulps.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne whispers to the group, "What the hell is she doin'?"<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack folds his arms over his chest.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra glances at Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Siwas touch your mind:<br>
            "I knew you still had that!"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "His hold on her is strong."<br>
            <br>
            You squeakily say, "Petal."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "You recognize it?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Defense, continue your questioning."<br>
            <br>
            (Kinshack looks around the courtroom, his face
            expressionless.)<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "I am not on the stand."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Toward the witness."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera gets a blank look on her face.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas points at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "She did not realize."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Was that given to you by Eryael?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros looks thoughtfully at you.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera wipes her sweaty hands on her skirt.)<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It wasn't in your hand a moment ago."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You seemed surprised to see it."<br>
            <br>
            Jacina mutters bitterly.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera shrugs, helplessly.)<br>
            <br>
            Perigourd whispers, "you know what's really sad"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Did you know it was there?"<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne shifts her eyes to you.<br>
            <br>
            Perigourd whispers, "there are people here in this room far
            guiltier of worse crimes than you've ever committed"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "It reminds her of their
            agreement.&nbsp; Of his pledge."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I wasn't paying attention."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Answer the question, please."<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire rolls her eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Perigourd whispers, "yet they stand never to trial"<br>
            <br>
            Poor baby!<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No..."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I'm sorry."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Let the court record show that the defendent
            unmindfully pulled out a memento given to her by Eryael."<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela rolls her eyes.<br>
            <br>
            You stare at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus shakes his head.<br>
            <br>
            Genivie shakes her head.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "Simply go with it, thief."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "So noted."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "It may save your life."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "It got harder to argue with him, didn't it?"<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Again..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "Time for the list of
            savages, I'm afraid."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I got tired."<br>
            <br>
            You clear your throat.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I mean, yes."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I have cause."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Leading the witness. I object, again."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera sinks an inch lower in her chair, her flush
            deepening.)<br>
            <br>
            Siwas tilts her head up.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I'm trying to establish why she fell under
            his power."<br>
            <br>
            Your jaw drops.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus furrows his brow.<br>
            <br>
            You angrily exclaim, "I didn't!"<br>
            <br>
            You stand back up.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I don't think it's much to ask how it
            happened.&nbsp; Gahread asked much the same questions about
            Mekth-"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias bites his lip.<br>
            <br>
            Genivie glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol frowns.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera begins to take a step, then stops.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Juspera, take your seat, please."<br>
            <br>
            Genivie raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Please be seated, Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            You take a deep breath.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar glances at Prospera.<br>
            <br>
            You sit down.<br>
            <br>
            (Jacina reaches for Kinshack.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "Seat yourself and calm
            down."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne bites her lip.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.<br>
            <br>
            You tremble.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas clasps her hand over her mouth.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "She certainly does."<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire smirks.<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack rubs Jacina gently.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera nods.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Very well, Defense... but be careful in
            your words."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Juspera...give me the specifics of what was
            done to you."<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Siwas touch your mind:<br>
            "That's it, Juspera.. show how you're really not in control
            of your temper. That's all it is.. temper. Not insanity, not
            possession.."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros places his hand on his Sheru symbol.<br>
            <br>
            You feel the blood drain from your face.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros closes his eyes for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera folds her arms over her chest.<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros whispers quietly.)<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "You mean the... in the Nations, the...?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Uh..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I'm establishing how and why a person
            attracts the attention of such a creature."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Whether it be a shadow, or a man with a
            flower."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas traces the lines of her thin scar.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas shifts her weight.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Maimara and Achillea and Rumpkin had me tied to a
            bed and they cut the skin off my arm and burned it, and
            Maimara ate my finger and Achillea cut my face up..."<br>
            <br>
            You clear your throat.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "And that was just one time?"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias breathes in slightly.<br>
            <br>
            (Vonka covers her ears and shuts her eyes.)<br>
            <br>
            A pained expression crosses Prospera's face.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "You had me nailed to a table, and Rekarth blew my
            limbs off, and Aramana cut open my stomach and took out
            my... guts and ate them in front of me, and you cut open my
            face."<br>
            <br>
            Prospera says, "eew"<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera's voice takes on a dull quality as she speaks.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I cut your hand, too."<br>
            <br>
            (Vonka rubs her stomach.)<br>
            <br>
            Achillea glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol frowns.<br>
            <br>
            Perigourd asks, "and you folks have juspera on trial?"<br>
            <br>
            Perigourd smirks.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne slowly empties her lungs.<br>
            <br>
            (Jacina squeezes Vonka's shoulder and pulls her close,
            whispering sweetly to her.)<br>
            <br>
            You monotonously say, "Grhim had me tied up and Sepher and
            you, and he pulled out my teeth while I was alive and
            conscious..."<br>
            <br>
            (Kinshack leans back and stretches his arms out to either
            side of him on the bench, one draped around Jacina's
            shoulders, the other drumming idly against the wood.&nbsp;
            His face still expressionless as he watches Juspera.)<br>
            <br>
            Vonka whimpers.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne cringes.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol's face turns slightly pale.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera clears her throat.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros smiles slightly.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "There was another time with Aramana, yes?"<br>
            <br>
            You monotonously say, "Pyrocite and Aramana caught me spying
            and they put a knife in my kidney and dragged me around for
            an hour to keep the guards from rescuing me..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera nods just perceptibly.)<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne's face turns slightly pale.<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire examines her fingernails.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas tersely says, "I cannot see what possible bearing this
            has on the proceedings. None of those involved were the ones
            Juspera attacked.."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka bursts into tears!<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias clenches his jaw.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "We punished you.&nbsp; For doing your duty to
            the Resistance."<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol glances at Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar tilts his head down.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol grins wryly.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I've already explained the reasons for my
            questioning."<br>
            <br>
            Jacina clasps her arms around her knees and rocks back and
            forth.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Indeed."<br>
            <br>
            You monotonously say, "Sepher staked me to the ground and
            cut open my eye, my thigh and my arm, and my face... he
            staked me with arrows... he sat on top of me..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I don't see why I need to do so again."<br>
            <br>
            Perigourd's entire body tenses as he clenches his fist.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka sobs.<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            You think to yourself for awhile...<br>
            Roundtime 10 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "I believe that is enough of it."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I'm not sure she can stop."<br>
            <br>
            Achillea scowls.<br>
            <br>
            You monotonously say, "And..."<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros stares triumphantly at Juspera, his eyes gleaming
            brightly.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Draezir..."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "You made fun of him, didn't you?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No, I take it back."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros quietly says, "Yes..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "At first?"<br>
            <br>
            You tremble.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow in your direction.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Tell us about him."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No, I was lying."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "Tell them now."<br>
            <br>
            Rinika raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            You quickly say, "No, I take it back, none of those things
            happened."<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire folds her arms over her chest.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Juspera, tell us about Draezir."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Answer her question please."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Rinika.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Rinika."<br>
            <br>
            (Vonka leans forward, clutching her stomach tightly.)<br>
            <br>
            You stand back up.<br>
            <br>
            You stride over to stand before Rinika.<br>
            <br>
            You see Rinika the Poetess.<br>
            She appears to be a Human from Dragach.<br>
            She appears to be youthful and shorter than average.&nbsp;
            She has bright sea green eyes and freckled skin.&nbsp; She
            has shoulder length, wavy red hair worn in two
            pigtails.&nbsp; She has a round face, a small nose and
            pouting lips.<br>
            She is in good shape.<br>
            She is holding a rose-clasped soft blue suede book in her
            right hand.<br>
            She is wearing a bright coppery vultite shield, some vultite
            cuirbouilli leather, an embroidered sunny yellow skirt, a
            snowflake embroidered pouch, a deep blue leather baldric, a
            deep blue satin cloak, a blue flower-trimmed hat, a
            periwinkle blue bowtie, a paint-stained smock, a braided
            penguin-clasped belt, some black high-buttoned shoes, a
            sleek black compass case, a grey Jastev ring, and a crystal
            amulet.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika tilts her head up.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Juspera, sit back down."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera tries to take Rinika's book.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra raises her hand.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika asks, "Er... Juspera?"<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Juspera does not have to answer any
            questions, actually."<br>
            <br>
            You tremble like a leaf.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Take it off the record."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "She is the defendent, it is her right."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros closes his eyes and begins whispering quietly.)<br>
            <br>
            Mnar glances at Prospera.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros places his hand on his Sheru symbol.<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika hesitantly gives her book to Juspera.)<br>
            <br>
            Genivie rolls her eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow in Rinika's direction.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika offers you a rose-clasped soft blue suede book.&nbsp;
            Enter ACCEPT to accept the offer or DECLINE to decline
            it.&nbsp; The offer will expire in 30 seconds.<br>
            You accept Rinika's offer and are now holding a rose-clasped
            soft blue suede book.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Sit down, please."<br>
            <br>
            Jacina glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            (Kinshack smirks slightly and shakes his head.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Juspera, let her keep it."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And sit down."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera rips the last page out of the book, tears it with
            her teeth then lets it fall to the floor.)<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "It has been stated.&nbsp; Return the book
            and sit down."<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks at you.<br>
            <br>
            You offer your soft blue suede book to Rinika, who has 30
            seconds to accept the offer.&nbsp; Type CANCEL to
            prematurely cancel the offer.<br>
            <br>
            You turn around.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika works her fingers under her flower-trimmed hat and
            scratches her head.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias tilts his head down.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika has accepted your offer and is now holding a
            rose-clasped soft blue suede book.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Please."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika looks about with a puzzled expression on her face.<br>
            <br>
            Genivie shakes her head.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias rests his forehead in his hand.)<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas glances down at the page on the floor.)<br>
            <br>
            You tremble.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas looks at you, puzzled.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol shakes his head.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus shakes his head.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera returns to the stand.)<br>
            <br>
            You feel a bit weak in the knees and find yourself wobbling.<br>
            <br>
            You sit down.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Let's try this once more."<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika watches Juspera with a pleading 'what?' expression.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "After these...tortures..."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They didn't happen."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "You lie before Koar."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You got more from just the Alliance
            supporters."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "Before... Koar."<br>
            <br>
            Prospera glances at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera pushes back into her chair.)<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            (Jacina hums quietly to Vonka, swaying slightly with her
            arms around her.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "Tell them the truth."<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol blinks at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You were also subject to the will of the
            priests."<br>
            <br>
            Rinika gazes thoughtfully at her soft blue suede book.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "To Eryael.&nbsp; To Draezir."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Tell them, Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            You clear your throat.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra exclaims, "List off all the things they said to
            you!"<br>
            <br>
            Aeillwyna turns an inquisitive ear towards you.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera stares at Ysharra, turning white, then flushed
            again.)<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You used to make fun of Draezir, here in
            Solhaven."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Oh, excuse me."<br>
            <br>
            You weakly say, "Yes..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "At the time it was Nighthaven."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros quietly says, "Nighthaven."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros nods.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What did he do?"<br>
            <br>
            Rinika shudders.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias raptly watches and listens to Juspera.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Come on.&nbsp; Tell us about your
            punishments."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He killed me a lot. He bound me and let his
            soldiers kill me. He sent me waking nightmares. He locked me
            in a room and set it on fire."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar winces.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Your hands."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera pulls her hands into loose fists.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "He made your hands explode, didn't he?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "...the jackals ate them off."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne bites her lip.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias wrinkles his nose.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "And this happened again, didn't it?"<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "The jackals came."<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika fold her arms over in a thoughtful expression.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "And what did they do?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Pulled me down, ate parts of me."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka shudders.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "They mauled you."<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias looks vaguely ill.)<br>
            <br>
            Frau gags.<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika passes a hand over her freckled face.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "And what else?"<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas looks a bit ill herself, taking a sudden fascination
            in the ceiling.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They didn't do anything else. They were
            nightmares."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Nightmares?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "You mean...you saw these things, in your
            sleep?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Waking nightmares."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra blinks at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "When I displeased Draezir in Solhaven, or that
            night in Sylvarraend."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Tell us about that night."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne shivers.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And what your...nightmares did."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra touches Eponyne.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra moves to stand behind Eponyne.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I was fighting in the invasion and heard a growl,
            then the jackals came and ate me."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I survived and I went to Sylvarraend but I kept
            hearing growling."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne closes her eyes for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            (Ysharra lays a hand on Eponyne's shoulder, never lowering
            her gaze from the witness stand.)<br>
            <br>
            Siwas folds her arms over her chest.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas sighs.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas shifts her weight.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Then after that was when I started eating people."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And after that was all over, more jackals."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol shifts his weight.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne bites her lip.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas gets an odd look on her face for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Do you know who you killed?"<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias nods slowly.)<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina's face turns slightly pale.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Eponyne and Quinstol."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "They're here today."<br>
            <br>
            (Eponyne nods faintly.)<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "They were also meant to be my witnesses."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Now."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Let's move west."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You shift your weight.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And tell me what happened to you on the night
            of the 26th."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Start from when?"<br>
            <br>
            (Jacina's eyes flicker up toward Quinstol, then back to
            Vonka.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You said you were angry."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "About Maimara."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Kinshack told me Maimara'd given up the piece."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "That's when the bad things started."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire narrows her eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "To Eryael."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I got dizzy and my vision got--"<br>
            <br>
            You clear your throat.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "My vision got cloudy."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "You couldn't see?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I could see. Not well."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Distorted."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I lost my peripheral vision"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Everything had a red tint."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros looks thoughtfully at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Like a gatehorse with blinders-a very
            oddly-colored set."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I know I passed out because I remember coming to
            in Maimara's sanctuary."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Was she there when this happened?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "After that I don't remember much for a bit, I was
            at a table with Maimara and Kinshack."<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "So Maimara saw you passed out?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I wanted to hurt Maimara, when I looked at her I
            saw blood on her face."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yeah."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "She would have seen me come to."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Interesting.&nbsp; Could have sworn she
            testified that you didn't."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Maybe she even made the sanctuary for me because I
            was passed out."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "Objection..."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "The witness has no basis for this
            speculation."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "True."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods.<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "No argument."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Gahread.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "So I was at the table and Maimara left before I
            could hurt her."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "So I went to see Tierus."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I don't remember much of that."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Tierus, the Mularosian."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I needed to hurt somebody."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But I couldn't--"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yeah."<br>
            <br>
            (Songowl furrows his brow, begins flipping through the
            scraps of paper he had been jotting things on, then huddles
            with the jurors.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Who had been a part of some of the attacks on
            you."<br>
            <br>
            You bite your lip.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers, "Troll juice!"<br>
            <i>(?!?)</i><br>
            <br>
            You say, "He has attacked me and tried to use a spell on me
            to make me bloodlust...ful."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But not torture."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You clearly say, "No one tortured me."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Some sort of...trollblood concoction, as I
            recall."<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What happened with Tierus?"<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I don't remember."<br>
            <br>
            Rinika carefully opens a rose-clasped soft blue suede book.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias shifts uncomfortably in his seat.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "She doesn't."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It was in the temple of Mularos."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "You went to see him, but you don't remember
            what you spoke about?"<br>
            <br>
            You shake your head.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "I know.&nbsp; That's good,
            actually."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What's the next thing you recall?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I had to give him back something he lent me,
            maybe... er, sorry."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Trying to find an enemy, to hurt them."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "Yes, the horn."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But I couldn't find one."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias tilts his head down.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas furrows her brow.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Couldn't find Maimara, or Tierus, or Alisaire..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "An enemy...someone who'd hurt you?"<br>
            <br>
            (Jacina idly runs her fingertips along her mouth.)<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I see."<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika turn pages and adds up some more scribbles,
            correcting things and adding sketches.)<br>
            <br>
            You weakly say, "But I was desperate."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "So what happened when your search proved no
            Alliance supporters?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I found someone I thought I could beat up."<br>
            <br>
            You clear your throat.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Xanthias."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Ah, right."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias bites his lip.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Because he's not very manly."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias tilts his head down.<br>
            <br>
            Your cheeks take on a slightly flushed tone.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias doesn't manage to not flush.)<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "That is what you said, right?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I had said so, in the past."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "After what happened to him with Siwas I knew he
            was a very strong person."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias gulps.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But I just... wasn't thinking that night."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka gives Xanthias a quick little smooch.<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas turns an odd shade of pale beneath her dusky
            complexion.)<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias blushes a nice shade of rosy pink.<br>
            <br>
            You remove a fancy pink bandana from in your cotton
            haversack.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I just remembered this."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "He'd been tortured like you, but at the time,
            you weren't thinking right."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods.<br>
            <br>
            You put a fancy pink bandana in your cotton haversack.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And I pulled him upstairs in the inn and tried to
            cut up his face."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas clenches her fist.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka winces.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "It's a common theme for what happened to you,
            isn't it?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But he resisted and that wasn't any good, so I
            left."<br>
            <br>
            You blink at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You take a deep breath.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Because he's strong."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "So you...had to find someone else?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Who did you find?"<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack clenches his jaw.<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack glances at Jacina.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros leans back.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yeah."<br>
            <br>
            You point at Jacina.<br>
            <br>
            You clear your throat.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina closes her eyes for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack gently rests his hand on Jacina's shoulder.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I had to. I had to do it."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros smiles slightly, looking at Juspera with a fixed
            gaze.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I took her in the inn and I did it."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Describe did it."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias bites his lip.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina seems to be trying to figure out how to turn an ivory
            silk handkerchief.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I threw her down and hit her in the face."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka hugs Jacina.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Then Kinshack and Maimara came in."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Maimara said she was a bloody wreck on the
            floor."<br>
            <br>
            You quietly say, "And I just wanted Kinshack to stop me like
            in Sylvarraend."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But he had Jacina to attend to."<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            (Jacina swallows hard.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It seems like more than just a kick."<br>
            <br>
            You shake your head.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I don't remember."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "All right..."<br>
            <br>
            (Kinshack stares icily at Juspera.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And so they left you to run off, so they
            could care for her."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Maimara stayed and then Mnar showed up."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka rubs Jacina.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I don't remember much from then."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I was... it hurt."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They wouldn't let me out and I had to hurt
            someone."<br>
            <br>
            (Alisaire settles back in her chair.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But it was a sanctuary."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And they were too strong to pull down on the
            ground."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "So it hadn't been enough?"<br>
            <br>
            Aeillwyna looks thoughtfully at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I needed more."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera's voice gets a little hoarse.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "The punishments you'd doled out?"<br>
            <br>
            You take a deep breath.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I felt like I would pass out again."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Did you?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Mekthros, Mekthros revealed himself, he'd been
            there invisible the whole time and I tried to get him."<br>
            <br>
            You shake your head.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Ah, I see."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "A supporter."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I got out and Mekthros got out and I told him to
            meet me in a cave outside town."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He would let me hurt him."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It would be good."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "An enemy."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But I went there and waited and he didn't come."<br>
            <br>
            You grimace.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "So you left?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros smiles slightly.<br>
            <br>
            You quietly say, "And then... I heard Vonka on the net."<br>
            <br>
            You tremble.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne sighs.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And I had to. I had to do it. Vonka."<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika's gaze slowly shifts from Mekthros to Juspera.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Vonka.&nbsp; Who had made you angry."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros nods.<br>
            <br>
            You blink at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes, but... no... you should hear her scream...
            she cried for Eryael..."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka furrows her brow.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I told her to meet me in the Captain's Rest."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Vonka cried for Eryael?"<br>
            <br>
            Jacina looks at Vonka blankly, at a loss to express herself.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And I did it to--"<br>
            <br>
            Vonka nods.<br>
            <br>
            You squeakily say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus furrows his brow.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra looks thoughtfully at you.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera furrows her brow.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Are you absolutely certain about that?"<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika discreetly glance at Mekthros and makes a quick,
            swift sketching in her book.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias shifts his position several times, unable to get
            comfortable in his chair.)<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol shifts his weight.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera seems puzzled.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera shrinks back.)<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus leans back.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "She should be."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You found her in the Rest..."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "She did."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "Vonka, that is."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I threw her down and I cut her. Just enough to
            hear her make that noise."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But then I went back to wait for Mekthros."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Mekthros was an enemy."<br>
            <br>
            You breathe rapidly, your nostrils flaring.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You'd finally found what you wanted."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And I did the whole job on him."<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros locks eyes with Juspera, nodding his head once.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And I finished, and then I felt better."<br>
            <br>
            You clear your throat.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka shudders.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Fingernails, face, stomach?"<br>
            <br>
            Jacina rubs Vonka gently.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What about his eyebrows?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "All his fingernails gone. His face all cut up."<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            You shake your head.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Anything else, Juspera?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros smiles at Juspera, a dull glint in his eyes.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "That's all I did to him."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Then I went back to town and I locked myself in
            the Trading Post."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne bites her lip.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I thought the world was going to end."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But Vonka came to sleep in the bed beside me."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Vonka did?"<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela blinks.<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Achillea blinks at Vonka.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "The one crying for Eryael?"<br>
            <br>
            Rinika bites her lip.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka nods.<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina leans back.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka says, "I weren' cryin' out fer 'im...."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka clasps her hand over her mouth.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And the next few days..."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka glances at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka hangs her head.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "The jury will ignore Vonka's outburst."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "There's a theory in Mularosian dogma."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "That says all cries go out to him."<br>
            <br>
            Perigourd snorts.<br>
            <br>
            You monotonously say, "And the next few days I just..."<br>
            <br>
            Songowl nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            You shake your head.<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela rolls her eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Did you speak to any of the other victims?"<br>
            <br>
            You clear your throat.<br>
            <br>
            You notice a vein pulsing in Xanthias's forehead.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Objection. The Defense is not qualified to
            speak on.. oh, nevermind"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Withdrawn."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas shakes her head.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I spoke with Xanthias last night. And that's all."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Mekthros, if he counts. Every day, Mekthros. He
            thought to me all the time."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Hours every day."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros smiles dimly.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Well, he's a Sheruvian."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "An enemy."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "One in a long line of people on the Alliance
            side who have had it out for you."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "And more than just that, eh?"<br>
            <br>
            You shift your weight.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "That's enough."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera glances at the torn page on the floor.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I'm just making a circle."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You repeatedly asked for why I was bringing
            it up."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Now you know."<br>
            <br>
            You weakly say, "I did it. I hurt those people."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "We all know that, Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne sighs.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias rubs his jaw slightly.)<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias frowns.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Your fingers were sliced open by me."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Your stomach by Aramana."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera pulls her hands into loose fists again.)<br>
            <br>
            Rinika shudders.<br>
            <br>
            You quietly say, "No."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Punishments meted out over and over."<br>
            <br>
            Genivie glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Achillea shakes her head.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It's not at all curious that they popped up
            again, in your own actions."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What did Xanthias have to say?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Was he angry with you?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He just offered me his support."<br>
            <br>
            Jacina glances at Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He might have been, but he didn't express it."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias clears his throat.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "So...out of those who you attacked..."<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias avoids everyone's gaze.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Most of them don't want you prosecuted."<br>
            <br>
            You quietly say, "I guess."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Objection, hearsay. None of the witnesses have
            stated such."<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika conspicuously leans over to Vonka and shows her a
            sketch in her book.)<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Sustained."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "I vill state as such."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias bites his lip.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus frowns.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "You're not on the stand."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas glances at Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Sorry."<br>
            <br>
            Genivie shakes her head.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina scowls at Xanthias.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias gulps.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Move to strike that from the record."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias tilts his head down.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas peers quizzically at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "The jury will ignore Xanthias' outburst."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods.<br>
            <br>
            Songowl nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Mekthros echo in your mind:<br>
            "The trial of Juspera Spintari enters its fifth hour in the
            Trading Post."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I'm finished."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Very well."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Siwas."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne slowly empties her lungs.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            You squirm.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias grits his teeth.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "I'll make this as fast as I can."<br>
            <br>
            <a name="juspera2"></a>Siwas says, "Juspera. Just to recap."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "You assaulted Vonka, Jacina, and Xanthias.
            Yes?"<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "You tried to stab Xanthias, yes?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas peers quizzically at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I don't remember."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Just hitting him."<br>
            <br>
            (Jacina touches her hand to her cheek.)<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "But you DO remember attacking all three of
            them?"<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias bites his lip.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "You must, since you told ME about it a day or
            two later."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Do you enjoy hurting people, Juspera?"<br>
            <br>
            You feel the blood drain from your face.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika cocks her head at you.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera sinks down yet another inch in her chair.)<br>
            <br>
            You quietly say, "Sometimes."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "You've said it makes you feel powerful. Do you
            enjoy that?"<br>
            <br>
            You quietly say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "It's like a drug, isn't it? The power over
            someone else, knowing they can't stop you."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas peers quizzically at you.<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Careful, Counsel."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            (Alisaire flips her hand limply.)<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Apologies."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;l<br>
            [Trading Post, Foyer]<br>
            The foyer is decorated with banners from nearby
            cities.&nbsp; A large, pine desk sits in one corner of the
            room.&nbsp; Near the entrance, a rickety podium, covered
            with a thick layer of dust, stands to greet visitors.&nbsp;
            Chairs and tables, clearly not often used, are placed at
            intervals along the unadorned wooden walls.&nbsp; You also
            see an ash wood arch with a small wooden sign on it, a thick
            canvas curtain and a curving staircase.<br>
            Also here: Divid who is sitting, Thrassus who is sitting,
            Lumaco, Alisaire who is sitting, Atoyoz, Kinshack who is
            sitting, Perigourd, Xeniphite, Cappurnicus, Revalos who is
            sitting, Genivie who is sitting, Quinstol who is sitting,
            Rhyshadow who is sitting, Lecea who is sitting, Songowl who
            is sitting, Prospera, Mnar who is sitting, Eponyne who is
            sitting, Mekthros who is sitting, Lady Ysharra, Xanthias who
            is sitting, Vonka who is sitting, Gahread who is sitting,
            Lady Jacina who is sitting, Siwas, Rinika who is sitting,
            Ariafela who is sitting, Aeillwyna who is sitting, Achillea
            who is sitting<br>
            Obvious exits: out<br>
            <br>
            Aeillwyna furrows her brow.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "You had an interesting youth, Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "You were a member of a gang, were you not?"<br>
            <br>
            You shift your weight.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            Rinika idly scrawls something on a page in her soft blue
            suede book.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "And a hallmark of this gang was to hurt people
            by straddling them and pinning their arms with their knees,
            wasn't it?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "And raking a dagger down their cheeks?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas peers quizzically at you.<br>
            <br>
            You take a deep breath.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina blinks.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Achillea blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela shifts her weight, trembling slightly.<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina's jaw drops.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros smirks.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "..just as you have done recently. Odd. That's
            how you pinned down Jacina, Vonka, and Xanthias, isn't it?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka shudders.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera squirms back into her chair.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            You abruptly say, "I was twelve--"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "In fact, you still bear a symbol.. so to
            speak.. of your time with the gang."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera closes her mouth.)<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "True, or no?"<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas glances sharply at Juspera.)<br>
            <br>
            Mnar frowns.<br>
            <br>
            You shake your head.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias watches Juspera closely.)<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Not that I know of."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros's face turns slightly pale.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "No? Not at all?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "You are under oath."<br>
            <br>
            You shake your head.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Remember that."<br>
            <br>
            Prospera glances at Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            You clear your throat.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Objection."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Withdrawn."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Let me rephrase."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Juspera, do you bear a symbol, a brand, tattoo,
            or what have you.. or some sort of other permanent
            remembrance of your time in this gang?"<br>

          Alisaire slips her gloves easily off her hands.<br>
          <br>
          Alisaire put some cuffed bronze suede gloves in her woven wool
          satchel.<br>
          <br>
          (Siwas purses her lips thoughtfully, pausing.)<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Juspera is under oath to tell the truth."<br>
          <br>
          Alisaire examines her fingernails.<br>
          <br>
          You quietly say, "I lost my maidenhead there, but that's all."<br>
          <br>
          Your cheeks take on a slightly flushed tone.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "She is not under oath to answer, as the
          defendent."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas gets an odd look on her face for a moment.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka looks rather confused.<br>
          <br>
          Xanthias tilts his head down.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina coughs.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "That was.. more than I needed to know."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas coughs.<br>
          <br>
          Thrassus scratches his head.<br>
          <br>
          Rinika scratches her chin.<br>
          <br>
          A pained expression crosses Atoyoz's face.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "Regardless.. you harmed these people in the SAME
          WAY you did years ago, in your gang."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "And you have a history of harming people like
          this."<br>
          <br>
          You close your eyes for a moment.<br>
          <br>
          You nod.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "You do, don't you?"<br>
          <br>
          You quietly say, "Yes."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "You hurt others in Ta'Illistim like that."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas turns around.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "In fact, I daresay you were in your right mind
          the entire time, Juspera.."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "You knew what you were doing. You remembered all
          of it."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Did you not?"<br>
          <br>
          (Juspera flushes, slipping down another half-inch in her
          seat.)<br>
          <br>
          (Siwas turns back towards Juspera.)<br>
          <br>
          You shake your head.<br>
          <br>
          You ask, "I remember maybe... two thirds...?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "No? You said earlier that you remembered
          attacking them."<br>
          <br>
          You nod.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "I refer only to the attacks you made on the three
          in question."<br>
          <br>
          You say, "I don't remember... how long I took... exactly what
          I said... how much I hit them..."<br>
          <br>
          You say, "Just a blur."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "So, you have admitted that you attacked them,
          that you enjoy hurting others because of the power it gives
          you, and that you have a history of doing exactly this sort of
          assault, yes?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas peers quizzically at you.<br>
          <br>
          You hang your head.<br>
          <br>
          You nod.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Speak louder, please?"<br>
          <br>
          Rinika sighs quietly.<br>
          <br>
          Xanthias slowly empties his lungs.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas turns an inquisitive ear towards you.<br>
          <br>
          You quietly say, "Yes."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "No further questions."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra smiles.<br>
          <br>
          Achillea smiles quietly to herself.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "I have no more witnesses, your honor."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Thank you Juspera.&nbsp; You may return to
          your seat."<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi ysh You might mention in your final statement that
          Draezir knows Juspera has a history... and who else would he
          choose to control?<br>
          You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Very well."<br>
          <br>
          You stand back up.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas sits down.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers, "I will."<br>
          <br>
          Rinika tilts her head up.<br>
          <br>
          You sit down.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Then we will move to closing arguments."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Prosecution, please proceed."<br>
