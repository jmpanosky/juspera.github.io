            You glance down at your empty hands.<br>
            <br>
            Atoyoz rests a gentle hand on Evelith's arm.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera glances at a curving staircase.<br>
            <br>
            Songowl's group came down a curving staircase.<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika wanders up into a corner, watching the scene
            carefully as she scribbles notes down in her book.)<br>
            <br>
            [Trading Post, Foyer]<br>
            The foyer is decorated with banners from nearby
            cities.&nbsp; A large, pine desk sits in one corner of the
            room.&nbsp; Near the entrance, a rickety podium, covered
            with a thick layer of dust, stands to greet visitors.&nbsp;
            Chairs and tables, clearly not often used, are placed at
            intervals along the unadorned wooden walls.&nbsp; You also
            see an ash wood arch with a small wooden sign on it, a thick
            canvas curtain and a curving staircase.<br>
            Also here: Keya, Rhyshadow, Lecea, Lady Nikia, Songowl,
            Xeniphite, Prospera, Genivie, Mnar, Quinstol, Eponyne,
            Revalos, Mekthros, Lady Ysharra, Xanthias, Maimara, Vonka,
            Kinshack, Gahread, Lady Jacina, Siwas, Thrassus, Rinika,
            Ariafela, Aeillwyna, Chura, Briah, Sandez, Atoyoz, Lumaco,
            Perigourd, Lady Evelith, Achillea, Tebon, Kaishaku<br>
            Obvious exits: out<br>
            <br>
            Prospera seems to be waiting for something.<br>
            <br>
            Rinika idly scrawls something on a page in her soft blue
            suede book.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus just strode down a curving staircase.<br>
            <br>
            (Songowl guides his group to the side of a room in full view
            and sits, motioning the same.)<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus walks to stand behind a rickety podium.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera recites:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All may be seated."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles at you.<br>
            <br>
            (Tebon steps to the back of the crowd)<br>
            <br>
            (Kaishaku leans against the back wall.)<br>
            <br>
            (Maimara perches on the edge of her chair, her hands folded
            in her lap.)<br>
            <br>
            Prospera recites:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Court is now in session."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas smiles encouragingly at Vonka before turning her
            attention to the front.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne sighs deeply.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera recites:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Overseer Cappurnicus presiding."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Prospera.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Good evening, everyone."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;group<br>
            Ysharra is the leader of your group.<br>
            Quinstol is also a member of your group.<br>
            Eponyne is also a member of your group.<br>
            Revalos is also a member of your group.<br>
            Mekthros is also a member of your group.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Before we begin... I ask that you remain
            as silent as possible during tonight's proceedings."<br>
            <br>
            Prospera recites:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Defendant Juspera Spintari is being
            tried on ...a long long list of aggravated assaults."<br>
            <br>
            Prospera clears her throat.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks at Prospera.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina closes her eyes for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera recites:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be more specific.."<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "Oh my." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "That was... vague."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "Yes...not quite what I was
            hoping for."<br>
            <br>
            Prospera recites:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two counts of aggravated assault, one
            count of assault with intent to kill."<br>
            <br>
            You feel the blood drain from your face.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Atoyoz touch your mind:<br>
            "You didn't listen to my warning, did you?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "Which was the intent to
            kill?"<br>
            <br>
            You focus your mind on Atoyoz and think:<br>
            "I'm sorry! He was my friend... I miss him."<br>
            Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "Jacina, I would assume."<br>
            <br>
            (Prospera takes her place next to the podium.)<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias bites his lip.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina tilts her head down.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Evelith touch your mind:<br>
            "I do not need judge or jury.&nbsp; You are damned in my
            eyes, and your black heart is plainly visible.&nbsp; You
            should simply stand up and scream out for Mularos. You did
            it once before, would it be so hard to do it again?"<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Atoyoz touch your mind:<br>
            "Your friend? You attacked him! You tried to kill him!"<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "I am shaking." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Very well... Prosecution, please begin."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "Me too!"<br>
            <br>
            (Prospera folds her arms over her chest, looking stern as an
            old maid schoolteacher.)<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne whispers, "That is t' be expected..."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas clears her throat.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "It is natural.&nbsp; Our
            case is sound, regardless."<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas turns to the jury slightly.)<br>
            <br>
            You focus your mind on Evelith and think:<br>
            "No. I'm so sorry."<br>
            Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "we are gathered here to decide the fate of one
            Juspera Spintari, charged with two counts of aggravated
            assault,and one count of assault with intent to kill for her
            actions on the night of Olaesta the 26th."<br>
            <br>
            You focus your mind on Atoyoz and think:<br>
            "I was having a bad night..."<br>
            Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Revalos whispers to the group, "considering I was never
            charged with...what I committed, I'm skeptical at best of
            this inquest as a whole."<br>
            <br>
            You clear your throat.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Atoyoz touch your mind:<br>
            "You had an odd way of showing your friendship."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Upon numerous occasions before this, she has
            tortured members of the Dark Alliance, not just for
            information or other gain, but simply to inflict
            punishment."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "That's the main reason
            you're here."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas gazes heavenward.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "She has hired herself for the torture of
            others, an act most mercenaries would shy away from."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas points at you.<br>
            <br>
            Your jaw drops.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers, "Do not let her bait you!"<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "I never did it for money!" to your group.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Evelith touch your mind:<br>
            "You should be thankful I do not tell them the things you
            told me."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "She has a long history of such attacks, but
            until recently they have all had a justified cause. An enemy
            of the people of her residence, a job done for hire. She had
            a reason beyond a simple lust for violence and pain."<br>
            <br>
            Lecea gasps.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "Don't!"<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne peers quizzically at Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol narrows his eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "Don't you dare, Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Atoyoz touch your mind:<br>
            "Having a bad night? Is that your excuse?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas quietly says, "Until recently."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "That changed just over three weeks ago when she
            savagely attacked Jacina, Xanthias and Vonka."<br>
            <br>
            Jacina wrings her hands.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "I won't attack her, or anything, anything like
            that." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "Why would she do such a thing? Why would she
            inflict suffering on them with no apparent cause?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "Simply remain calm.&nbsp;
            We shall sort this out come your time."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas firmly says, "The answer is simple and direct."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne whispers, "Stay silent. Even if you say
            anythin'...they will see that as a loss of control."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "She enjoyed it."<br>
            <br>
            You close your eyes for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "She enjoyed the act of inflicting pain, mental
            and emotional. She enjoyed the malicious destruction she
            caused to those who once counted her among their friends.
            Jacina, Xanthias, Vonka and others she did not attack
            directly- Kinshack and Mnar among them."<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Atoyoz touch your mind:<br>
            "I've had many bad nights... but I never attacked my
            friends."<br>
            <br>
            Keya leans forward.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol whispers, "Back in your days... in the gang... that
            could be considered an occupation, I guess."<br>
            <br>
            Evelith nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            You focus your mind on Evelith and think:<br>
            "I'm sorry..."<br>
            Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers, "If you feel the hunger again, you must
            tell me before your vision blurs.&nbsp; I will prevent what
            I can."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi quinst Oh... yes...<br>
            You whisper quietly to Quinstol.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "We are here tonight to prove this to be true,
            and to see to it that Juspera Spintari harms no more
            innocent people."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi mek ...thank you.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "(And now, Juspera will show extreme calm and
            control, as I run to the bathroom.)" to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Thank you."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Siwas.</span></font></p>

            Siwas removes a large enruned black leather tome from in her

            Siwas carefully opens a large enruned black leather tome.<br>

            Ysharra smiles.<br>

            Ysharra stands up.<br>

            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Evelith touch your mind:<br>

            existence.&nbsp; Scream for him, Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And especially to the Freeholders, for
            allowing this at all.&nbsp; Many things have happened in
            this conflict that have had the nature of punishment,
            discipline...revenge."<br>

            Ysharra says, "It's a step I value, though I must admit, I
            do find it curious."<br>

            Atoyoz smirks.<br>

            You focus your mind on Evelith and think:<br>
            "I am sick..."<br>

            Ysharra says, "Even down to the particulars of this case."<br>

            <br>
            Ysharra says, "No one could argue that Juspera is innocent,

            Prospera furrows her brow.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "However, what we need to ascertain is whether
            or not it was a willing act of violence."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Atoyoz chortles softly at some secret joke.<br>

            Achillea smirks.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas stares at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias glances at Atoyoz.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Or if Juspera is at the whim of a greater
            force, be that the priests of this war..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Or even her own fragile sanity."<br>
            <br>
            Evelith rolls her eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Prospera raises an eyebrow.<br>

            Eponyne glances at Evelith.<br>

            powers, in this."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Many of us have been tempted.&nbsp; Or
            manipulated."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Or blessed."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I ask that you all remember those times,
            while we sit here tonight.&nbsp; And I will show you the
            way, with my case and my witnesses."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Thank you."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra curtsies.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra sits down.<br>
            <br>
            You think to yourself, "I know you are with me, my lord."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "(Still shaking!)"<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus clearly says, "Prosecution, call your first
            witness."<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol whispers to the group, "Shaking?&nbsp; You
            nervous?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas smiles at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas stands up.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "(Good job.)" to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "(I'm terrified.)"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas clearly says, "The Prosecution calls Lady Jacina."<br>
