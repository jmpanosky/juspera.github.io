            A rock wall, chinked with earth, wraps around the hillside
            to the west.&nbsp; The night brings mysterious shadows with
            it.&nbsp; A few stones have pushed out from the wall and now

            An arrow whistles into the room and hits Silverona!<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; ... 15 points of damage!<br>

            <br>
            You frown.<br>

            The heavy rainfall makes it difficult to see more than just
            a few feet ahead.<br>

            You hear three heavy *THUDS* on the gate.<br>

            You release an arrow and it goes flying into the distance!<br>

            You watch intently, but your arrow hits the ground.<br>
            Roundtime: 11 secs.<br>

            Suddenly you have the strangest feeling that you are being

            The feeling fades as quickly as it came.<br>

            in the drake's mouth.&nbsp; At the south end of the bridge a
            series of steps lead up to a hill.&nbsp; To the north, the

            You turn the iron wheel with all your might, and it slowly
            gives way with a screeching of metal.<br>
            Roundtime: 26 secs.<br>
            <br>
            The wheel whirls wildly as the ropes connecting it to the
            gate draw taut, and with a groaning of wood the gate closes!<br>
            <br>
            The surroundings are blurred with a downpour of obscuring

            You see Zerroth Wetchir the V'tullian Berserker.<br>
            He appears to be in the prime of life and is of an utterly
            towering height.&nbsp; He has solid crimson eyes and pale
            alabaster skin.&nbsp; He has long matted, black hair tied
            back tightly into a ragged ponytail.&nbsp; His hands appear
            to have been burnt into huge blackened talons, whose
            surfaces are wrought with crimson trails of fiery lava that
            shift restlessly with blurred waves of heat.<br>
            He has numerous dark markings branded deeply into the flesh
            of his face.<br>
            He is in good shape.<br>
            He is holding a massive serrated black ora sword in his
            right hand.<br>
            He is wearing a suit of heavily stained black plate set with
            curved shoulder-spikes, a pair of ragged black leather boots
            reinforced with stained iron, a dark iron-bound sheath, and
            a tattered deep crimson cape.<br>

            [Whistler's Pass, Bridge]<br>
            An iron bridge curves off to the southwest toward another
            hilltop.&nbsp; A fog bank shrouds the northern path in
            darkness and perpetual mist.&nbsp; You also see a white-clad

            &nbsp;...and hit the ground with a sickening *THUD*!<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; ... 20 points of damage!<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Good blow to your back!<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; You are stunned for 3 rounds!<br>

            wide-eyed for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Linor says, "what the heck"<br>

            leading to a small encampment.<br>
            <br>
            You stand back up.<br>
            Roundtime: 5 sec.<br>
            <br>
            You grunt.<br>
            <br>
            Cemb asks, "it's closed?"<br>
            <br>
            Fremie exclaims, "Zerroth is inside the camp!"<br>

            leading to a small encampment.<br>
            <br>
            You vigorously shake your head.<br>
            <br>
            BONK! You smash your nose.<br>
            <br>
            Bartain knocks on a spiked wooden gate leading to a small
            encampment.<br>
            <br>
            I'm afraid that you can't pull that.<br>
            <br>
            With a roar, Kinshack lowers his shoulder and charges the

            <br>
            Thaxius gestures at a spiked wooden gate leading to a small
            encampment.<br>
            You hear a soft click from the gate and it suddenly flies
            open.<br>
            <br>
            You belt out, "Fine! We don't need the stupid encampment
            anyway!"<br>
            <br>
            A white-clad elven medic crawls north.<br>
