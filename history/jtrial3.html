          Siwas clearly says, "The Prosecution calls Lady Jacina."<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Atoyoz touch your mind:<br>
          "You think you'll shirk responsibility that easily?"<br>
          <br>
          Quinstol whispers to the group, "(Agreed.)"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas turns to face Jacina.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina nods.<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne whispers to the group, "(Preach on, sistah!)"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina stands up.<br>
          <br>
          Rinika idly scrawls something on a page in her soft blue suede
          book.<br>
          <br>
          (Siwas turns back to the front.)<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers to the group, "My my...her first."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina takes a deep breath.<br>
          <br>
          You whisper, "(I think by the end you'll have some of the
          people who were scowling and shaking their heads with tears in
          their eyes!)" to your group.<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Atoyoz touch your mind:<br>
          "If you're truly insane, then you should be put in the
          asylum."<br>
          <br>
          Revalos whispers to the group, "(heh...Law and Order is on)"<br>
          <br>
          (Jacina takes her position next to the stand.)<br>
          <br>
          You focus your mind on Atoyoz and think:<br>
          "I will take what comes."<br>
          Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>
          <br>
          (Fremie glances around nervously.)<br>
          <br>
          Atoyoz narrows her eyes.<br>
          <br>
          Prospera strides over to stand before Jacina.<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne whispers, "From laughing, or crying? Heh."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina tilts her head up.<br>
          <br>
          Prospera asks, "Jacina, raise your right hand please?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina nods to Prospera.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi epo Heyyy.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Eponyne.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina raises her hand.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina's hand trembles.<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne whispers, "I'm teasing."<br>
          <br>
          Prospera asks, "Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
          truth, and nothing but the truth so help you Koar?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "I do."<br>
          <br>
          Prospera nods.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi capp lol... did she just make that up?<br>
          You whisper quietly to Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          (Prospera returns to her place next to the podium.)<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Pogues echo in your mind:<br>
          "hello Solhaven"<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus whispers, "I was totally whispering to her what to
          say, and she made that up instead, apparently."<br>
          <i>(We did have extensive procedures, but were also pretty
            nervous, as you can see.)</i><br>
          <br>
          Prospera glances at Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "may I begin, Cappurnicus?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi cap Who takes over if we kill the bailiff?<br>
          You whisper quietly to Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          (Siwas moves from behind the table to stand nearer to Jacina.)<br>
          <br>
          <a name="jacina1"></a>Siwas says, "Jacina.."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Can you please tell the court what happened to
          you on the night of the 26th?"<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus whispers, "Heh."<br>
          <br>
          (Jacina takes her seat at the stand.)<br>
          <br>
          Jacina sits down.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Starting when you first saw the defendant?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas points at you.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "Yes..I had been looking for Tierus. "<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "He had just died, and I walked past her on my
          way to find him."<br>
          <br>
          Perigourd whispers, "you agreed to be tried by such biased
          people?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods to Jacina.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Go on?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "She was with Mnar."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Did you notice anything odd about her?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "Near the dark Arkati's temples. Yes. She was
          covered in blood, her hair was ragged, she was dripping with
          sweat."<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne whispers to the group, "(Bathroom break for me, too.)"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "And Mnar was clenching on to her, like he was
          restraining her."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Continue, please?"<br>
          <br>
          Prospera furrows her brow.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "Well I greeted them both, as if nothing was
          wrong, I assumed she had just gotten back from a hunt. She
          stared at me, and said my name, a few times. Then broke free
          of Mnar."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "She grabbed me by the throat of my cloak...and
          began to pull me down the street by it."<br>
          <br>
          Quinstol tilts his head down.<br>
          <br>
          Rhyshadow squints.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas frowns.<br>
          <br>
          (Siwas gazes with concern at Jacina, frowning slightly.)<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "And where did she take you?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina stares.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "She took me to the Solhaven Inn. A room there."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas quietly asks, "And what did she do once you were there?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina bites her lip.<br>
          <br>
          Prospera glances at Jacina.<br>
          <br>
          Mekthros smiles slightly.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "She moved in between the door and I..."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "I began to notice the blood on her wasn't from a
          beast."<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne glances at Jacina.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "I asked if she had killed Tierus."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina grins weakly.<br>
          <br>
          Fremie furrows his brow.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "And what did she say?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "She just took ragged breaths, and kept saying my
          name over and over."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "So she knew who you were, then?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "She was AWARE she was manhandling you, her
          friend?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina softly says, "Yes."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "What did she do to you, after she cut off your
          escape?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina softly says, "She um.."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina coughs.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka weeps softly, quiet tears falling from her eyes.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina softly says, "She ran her hand through my hair, almost
          tenderly at first."<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne frowns at Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          A pained expression crosses Prospera's face.<br>
          <br>
          You close your eyes for a moment.<br>
          <br>
          Xanthias gently rests his hand on Vonka's shoulder.<br>
          <br>
          (Jacina's eye move over to Vonka, and a look of determination
          comes over her.)<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "She pulled my hair, and she told me 'down'."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "She yanked at my head, and I asked her what was
          wrong. She just said down again."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka gazes at Jacina with a look of utter sorrow in her eyes.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "I...I kneeled."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "And she kicked me in the stomach with her knee."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "And said down again."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina sniffs.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "She attacked you, then?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas glances at you.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina tilts her head down.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina nods.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "What else did she do?"<br>
          <br>
          Rinika idly sketches something on a page in her soft blue
          suede book.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;l<br>
          [Trading Post, Foyer]<br>
          The foyer is decorated with banners from nearby cities.&nbsp;
          A large, pine desk sits in one corner of the room.&nbsp; Near
          the entrance, a rickety podium, covered with a thick layer of
          dust, stands to greet visitors.&nbsp; Chairs and tables,
          clearly not often used, are placed at intervals along the
          unadorned wooden walls.&nbsp; You also see an ash wood arch
          with a small wooden sign on it, a thick canvas curtain and a
          curving staircase.<br>

          sitting, Mange who is sitting, Lumaco who is sitting, Fremie

          <br>
          Jacina quietly says, "Once I was down on the ground, she put
          her boot to my throat. With just enough pressure that I
          couldn't swallow, but it wasn't choking me."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Go on?"<br>
          <br>
          (Siwas glances back over her shoulder at Juspera as Jacina
          details the attack.)<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi siwas 15 minutes taken with Jacina so far.<br>

          &gt;whi capp 15 minutes taken with Jacina so far.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina quietly says, "She moved to sit over me, on my arms, I
          couldn't move, or push her off."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara takes a deep breath.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina quietly says, "Not that I would think to do so, I kept
          hoping that this was some bad dream....one of her sick jokes."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina's lower lip trembles slightly.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas whispers, "Drat it.. ok, prodding her to talk faster."<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi siwas K.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina quietly says, "She began hitting me, over and over."<br>
          <br>
          Queylara just arrived.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "But it wasn't, was it?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods.<br>
          <br>
          Queylara says, "oh my I go to sleep and wake up to all of you"<br>
          <br>
          Kinshack stares at Jacina.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina quietly says, "With her fist, and the hilt of her
          weapon, on the face and cheek."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "So Juspera drew a weapon to attack you with?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "It was in her hand."<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi quey Hey. We're having a trial... you can sit down and
          watch, if you like.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Queylara.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "She bashed you in the face with the hilt of her
          dagger? While you were helpless and pinned?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas folds her arms over her chest.<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne cringes.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "I don't know what she intended with....and yes."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas shakes her head, clucking her tongue.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "How did you get away from her?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "When she got me to the room, I sent my guardian,
          Kinshack a thought. He came with Maimara, and must have pulled
          her off of me. I don't remember much...I must have blanked out
          a while from all the blows."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "How awful for you.. for a friend to attack you so
          viciously you'd black out like that."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas sighs.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "No further questions, Overseer."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus clearly says, "Very well."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas takes a few steps back.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas sits down.<br>
          <br>
          Prospera glances at Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus clearly says, "Defense, please proceed."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina places her hand on her white silk skirt.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra smiles at Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra stands up.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra strides over to stand before Jacina.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi ysh 20 minutes taken with this witness so far.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "It was awful.&nbsp; I can't imagine."<br>
          <br>
          <a name="jacina2"></a>Ysharra says, "Just a few questions, for
          you, dear, and then you can step down, and be done."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina nods.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "You said she drug you down the street by your
          cloak?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "Yes."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Covered in blood, and obviously in an agitated
          state?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "Aye."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Did you not resist her?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "No, I didn't."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "You were worried, I assume."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "That she was injured-you two are friends, yes?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "Well, I am not sure you could call us friends.
          But I do-did have a real concern for her."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra nods to Jacina.<br>
          <br>
          (Rinika's eyes shifts alternately to Jacina and her book,
          noting and sketching.)<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "And when she led you to a private room, you
          still didn't try to get away?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "Of course not. Anyone who knows Juspera knows
          she's always overdramatic."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers, "Help me out, if I'm forgetting
          anything.&nbsp; I feel so inadequate."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra chuckles.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Given."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina smiles slightly.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Actually, come to think on it."<br>
          <br>
          You shift your weight.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Has she ever been like this to you before, in
          some other measure?"<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Hostile...bullying?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "Well...yes."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "To you, personally?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "Yes."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Do you know why?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina glances at you.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "I wouldn't know."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "You couldn't make a guess why she singled you
          out."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina says, "I.."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina asks, "Wrong place, at the wrong times?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "Objection."<br>
          <br>
          Mange nods to Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "Jacina can't be expected to know what Juspera is
          thinking."<br>
          <br>
          Mange applauds Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas stares at Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Mnar frowns.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "I believe you made a few leading questions
          yourself."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra nods to Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus clearly says, "I agree... please take another
          route."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas raises an eyebrow in Ysharra's direction.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "...very well."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Just remember.&nbsp; This testimony was taken
          under oath."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra nods to Jacina.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "No further questions."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra turns around.<br>
          <br>
          Prospera nods.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra sits down.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Thank you Jacina, you may return to your
          seat."<br>
          <br>
          Jacina squints at Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina stands up.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina moves to stand behind Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          Alisaire raises an eyebrow in Mnar's direction.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods.<br>
          <br>
          (Siwas pats Jacina's arm as she walks by.)<br>
          <br>
          (Jacina takes her seat next to Kinshack.)<br>
          <br>
          Quinstol whispers to the group, "What was the other
          time?&nbsp; In Sylvarraend?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina sits down.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Next witness."<br>
          <br>
          Kinshack smiles barely.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas stands up.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi ysh K, swearing in took a couple minutes, Siwas took
          20 on her and you 5.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "The prosecution calls Vonka Yvanke."<br>
          <br>
          Mekthros whispers to the group, "That was one other time."<br>
          <br>
          Rinika idly scrawls something on a page in her soft blue suede
          book.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka bites her lip.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka stands up.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas smiles encouragingly at Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi capp K, swearing in took a couple minutes, Siwas took
          20 on her and Ysharra 5.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          Mekthros whispers to the group, "The night Eponyne died."<br>
          <br>
          Prospera strides over to stand before Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi siwas K, swearing in took a couple minutes, you took
          20 on Jacina and Ysharra 5. <br>
          You whisper quietly to Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          (Vonka shuffles over to the witness chair.)<br>
          <br>
          Prospera says, "Vonka, raise your right hand."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas whispers, "K.. thanks."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka raises her hand.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka glances at you.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka hangs her head.<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne whispers to the group, "The night several of us died."<br>
          <br>
          Prospera asks, "Do you swear on the integrity of this court to
          tell the truth?"<br>
          <br>
          Prospera cocks her head at Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka says, "Aye."<br>
          <br>
          Prospera nods.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas moves to stand in front of Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          <a name="vonka1"></a>Siwas says, "Vonka.."<br>
          <br>
          (Prospera returns to her place next to the podium.)<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "On the night of the 26th.."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "You were accosted by Juspera Spintari, yes?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Aye."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "She tol' me ter meet 'er at Cap'n's Rest."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "And you went to meet her?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "An' when I dun', she took me an' pulled me
          inter a room."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka nods.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Did she look strange at all?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "An' locked de door."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Was she covered in blood?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka nods.<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne bites her lip.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "She were covered in blood."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "An' she grabbed me hair, an' tol' me ter
          lie down on de bed."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "An' den she got on top o' me--like wit'
          Jacina."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas frowns.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "Let me ask you something, Vonka."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "When Juspera pinned you.."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Did she seem stronger than she normally does?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Or about the same?"<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Objection."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka ponders.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Vonka wasn't with Jacina."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas raises an eyebrow.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "She can't comment on testimony given in trial."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "So? Vonka knows Juspera."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Just on what she's witnessed."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "All right. Let me rephrase."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Please keep questions to material that they
          have experienced."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Okies."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Den she got on top o' me."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra smiles at Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Unlike anyone else."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "So, Juspera pinned you."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Yes?"<br>
          <br>
          Quinstol whispers to the group, "Tierus'?"<br>
          <br>
          Jacina smiles tenderly up at Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka nods to Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "She was about as strong as she normally is,
          right?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "You're her friend, you've seen her fight
          before.."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka looks rather confused.<br>
          <br>
          Genivie glances at Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Sometimes she kin be awful strong."<br>
          <br>
          You glance at Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas nods.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers, "What?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "All right.. continue, please?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "I kint say iffin she were stronger den she
          be."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka nods.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Den she hit me in de face wit' 'er han'."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "An' I cries out, like dis."<br>
          <br>
          Rinika idly scrawls something on a page in her soft blue suede
          book.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka wails!<br>
          <br>
          Rinika winces.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi ysh I... I dunno. I broke away from Kinshack that
          night in the Sylvarraend. I was just thinking, I guess.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Xanthias clears his throat.<br>
          <br>
          You bite your lip.<br>
          <br>
          Aeillwyna shivers.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "An' den she says, "Make dat noise agin.""<br>
          <br>
          Siwas softly asks, "How awful.. then what did she do to you?"<br>
          <br>
          Quinstol shifts his weight.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers, "I recall someone mentioning that, yes."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra nods to you.<br>
          <br>
          Jacina bunches up an ivory silk handkerchief in her fist.<br>
          <br>
          (Rinika bars something she previously scrawled and writes
          something beneath, adding a few doodles.)<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "An' I didn' know whut soun' she meant --
          acos I were makin' lotser sounds."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "So, she hits me agin."<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne sighs deeply.<br>
          <br>
          (Kinshack clasps Jacina's hand in his.)<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "An' I cries agin, an' den she gits up, all
          sudden like."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "An' she runs outer de room."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka bites her lip.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka hangs her head.<br>
          <br>
          Revalos whispers to the group, "hmm...should I speak with
          Prospera if I'm not particularly interested in swearing to
          Koar, but instead would rather swear by the Emperor's Honor?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "So, to sum up.. Juspera lured you to the inn,
          assaulted you and ordered you to scream, then fled?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas raises an eyebrow in Vonka's direction.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers to the group, "Just tell her who you will
          swear under.&nbsp; I'm sure it'll be mutable for all
          involved."<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Atoyoz touch your mind:<br>
          "Do you get pleasure out of hearing them talk about what you
          did to them?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Did she hold back at all, before running out?"<br>
          <br>
          Revalos whispers to the group, "I had not considered it until
          just now, I'll do so"<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers to the group, "I wouldn't expect Ali'shara or
          Mekthros to swear under Koar."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra smiles.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas asks, "Did she seem as though she didn't want to be
          hurting you?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka blinks.<br>
          <br>
          Mekthros whispers to the group, "They would naturally... not
          do so."<br>
          <br>
          You focus your mind on Atoyoz and think:<br>
          "I'm just nervous and scared, that's all."<br>
          Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas looks thoughtfully at Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Leading."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "It seemed like she almos' run out sos she
          wouldn' hurt me agin."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "She doesn't know what Juspera was thinking,
          either, eh?"<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "I'm merely asking for her own perceptions"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka nods to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "Withdrawn."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "No further questions, Overseer."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas takes a few graceful steps backwards.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas sits down.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra tilts her head up.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra smiles at Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Defense, your witness."<br>

          &gt;whi siwas K, that took 10 minutes.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Siwas.<br>

          &gt;whi capp K, that took 10 minutes.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra strides over to stand before Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          Quinstol whispers to the group, "I think she did more damage
          to herself than Juspera with that last line of questioning."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra smiles at Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Hello, Vonka."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka bites her lip.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Hey der."<br>
          <br>
          Revalos whispers to the group, "I tend to agree"<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Atoyoz touch your mind:<br>
          "What are you scared of? Haven't you been punished for your
          deed before?"<br>
          <br>
          <a name="vonka2"></a>Ysharra asks, "Tell me.&nbsp; How long
          have you known the defendant?"<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Atoyoz touch your mind:<br>
          "It doesn't seem to deter you from doing it again, hmm?"<br>
          <br>
          You focus your mind on Atoyoz and think:<br>
          "I'm sick."<br>
          Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Bout two years, I guess."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "How would you describe your relationship?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "She be nice."<br>
          <br>
          Paole slowly empties his lungs.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Were you close?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka nods.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Guesso."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra smiles at Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Have things changed recently?"<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Before these events?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka shakes her head.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas narrows her eyes.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "We was talkin' all frien'ly jus' a couple
          hours afore."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "What about your time in the Nations?"<br>
          <br>
          You focus your mind on Atoyoz and think:<br>

          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Atoyoz touch your mind:<br>

          responsibility for your actions."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka glances at you.<br>
          <br>
          You focus your mind on Atoyoz and think:<br>
          "No. I did it. That's why I asked for a trial."<br>
          Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>

          Ysharra asks, "Anything out of the ordinary happen there, with
          you, the defendant, etc.?"<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "That has bearing on what happened here, of
          course."<br>
          <br>
          You focus your mind on Vonka and think:<br>
          "Just tell them the truth, whatever it is."<br>
          Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas glances at Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka appears to be ignoring everything going on around her.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka looks rather confused.<br>
          <br>
          You tilt your head down.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Evert'in' der weren' ordinary."<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Atoyoz touch your mind:<br>
          "You asked for a trial to get justification for your actions."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra nods to Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly asks, "But yer wan' me ter talk bout dat night?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly asks, "When she got all mad at me?"<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Anything you can think of to help us understand
          would be a good thing."<br>
          <br>
          You focus your mind on Atoyoz and think:<br>
          "No. I give this to Koar. I will take whatever comes."<br>
          Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka furrows her brow.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Tell us about the night she got mad at you."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka nods.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Did you make fun of her?&nbsp; Kick her in the
          knee?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka blinks.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka shakes her head.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "I were tellin' 'er bout...."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka hangs her head.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "Objection, badgering the witness. Vonka is not on
          trial here for assault, Juspera is."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "It's all right, Vonka.&nbsp; We're here to find
          out what happened."<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne stares off into space.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Bout what happened ter me.... "<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Prosecution objects to establishing a history?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "An' she got all strange."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka glances at Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "I'll allow this much."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "It is relevant testimony."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Proceed with caution."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>

          Ysharra nods to Cappurnicus.<br>

          Ysharra says, "Always."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Go on, Vonka."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Just tell us what happened."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka nods.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "What did you tell her about?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "She said dat folks had dun' stuff ter 'er,
          ter."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Folks?"<br>
          <br>
          You close your eyes for a moment.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "I were tellin' 'er bout.... gittin'
          grabbed by de dark folks."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka nods.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Dark folks."<br>

          Achillea glances at Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Thrassus shifts his weight.<br>
          <br>

          Vonka softly says, "But she didn' say nuttin'."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "She got mad...at you...for being hurt by the
          dark folks?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "I t'ink she were mad acos I tol' folks
          bout it."<br>
          <br>
          You grimace.<br>

          Ariafela glances at you.<br>

          Ysharra asks, "So she was...jealous?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka shakes her head.<br>

          Cappurnicus nods.<br>

          Ysharra says, "Now, on the night in question."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "You said she didn't seem any stronger than
          usual?"<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi ysh Siwas and you both had her for 10 minutes each,
          now.<br>

          Vonka looks rather confused.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "I said I didn' know."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "You know how people get, when they're upset."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra nods to Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka nods to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Because she did seem upset, right, in your
          opinion?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka softly says, "Aye, dey kin git awful strong."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "She was upset, and agitated?"<br>
          <br>
          A low chirping sound comes from within a lacquered green
          cricket box.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Someone shut that cricket up, please."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Agreed."<br>
          <br>
          Fremie coughs.<br>

          Vonka furrows her brow.<br>
          <br>
          Prospera surveys the area.<br>
          <br>
          (Rinika discreetly ratifies something in her book.)<br>
          <br>
          Vonka says, "She were upset de night in de Elven nations."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra nods to Vonka.<br>
          <br>
          (Siwas drums her fingers lightly on the table in front of
          her.)<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "When she talked about what the Dark Alliance
          had done to her."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka says, "She weren't upset de night at Cap'n's Rest. She
          were sorter...."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka says, "'Scited."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "They'red tortured her.&nbsp; Like they had
          you."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas looks over at Gahread and shakes her head.<br>

          You take a deep breath.<br>

          Vonka says, "An' she were mad dat I had. I t'ink."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "She'd not looked for help, then."<br>
          <br>
          Vonka says, "Lessen she were mad about Eryael."<br>
          <br>
          You feel the blood drain from your face.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "About Eryael, the high priest of Mularos?"<br>
          <br>
          Vonka nods.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "Objection."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "Calls for speculation on the part of the witness,
          and opinions, not fact."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Identifying a potential influence is Vonka's
          opinion."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "And relevant."<br>

          Siwas glances at Cappurnicus.<br>

          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Ah dear."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas blinks at Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus slowly empties his lungs.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas cocks her head at Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus asks, "Pardon... what was said?"<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Vonka said that the defendant was angry."<br>

          treatment at the hands of the Dark Alliance."<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "I objected on the grounds it was requiring Vonka
          to speculate and give an opinion, since Vonka was giving a
          hypothesis about why she thought Juspera was angry."<br>

          other, at times.&nbsp; Usually when one of us is needing an
          ear to listen, or a shoulder to cry on.&nbsp; So to speak."<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi maim Go fast if you can and reply quickly over RPing
          much, so Siwas can get another witness in. Ooh, very good.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Maimara.<br>
          <br>
          Vonka sniffs.<br>
          <br>
          Tebon whispers, "I should start up a law firm here in Elanthia
          &lt;chuckles&gt;"<br>
          <br>
          Gahread nods to Maimara.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread asks, "So she tells you quite a bit of what she's
          thinking, does she not?"<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi tebon I was thinking about that for a PRO!<br>
          You whisper quietly to Tebon.<br>
          <br>
          Maimara whispers, "I'm way ahead of you. ;)"<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi maim Oh yeah baby.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Maimara.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra nods to Eponyne.<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Mekthros echo in your mind:<br>
          "The trial of Juspera Spintari continues in the Trading Post."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara shrugs.<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "Yes, at times.&nbsp; We've been known to have
          long mental discussions, and even longer face-to-face talks."<br>
          <br>
          Tebon whispers, "Heh, I've seen oh....bout thirty or so
          objections I coulda had"<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne rolls her eyes.<br>
          <br>
          (Rinika's gaze shifts up and down, her hand writing and
          sketching.)<br>
          <br>
          Gahread raises an eyebrow in Maimara's direction.<br>
          <br>
          Tebon whispers, "But, I am a Paladin, Justice is my field of
          expertise &lt;snickers&gt;"<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi tebon With trained, practiced and knowledgeable
          participants, it could be a great thing to do on a regular
          basis.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Tebon.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread asks, "Interesting. Did she mention anything to you
          during those discussions or talks about this trial, before
          tonight?"<br>
          <br>
          Tebon whispers, "And think of the fees &lt;ducks&gt;"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "She's mentioned it quite often, actually.&nbsp;
          Whenever she's under stress, she'll talk about it.&nbsp; "<br>
          <br>
          Maimara ponders.<br>
          <br>
          Tebon whispers, "rather unPaladin of me, I'd do it fer free,
          heh"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara clearly says, "She says this trial is her gift to
          Koar, whatever that means.&nbsp; I get the impression she
          wants somebody to hold her responsible for what she's done."<br>
          <br>
          You slowly and deliberately empty your filled lungs.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread says, "You've been talking quite a bit with her
          then..."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread frowns.<br>
          <br>
          You whisper, "Half the prosecution's witnesses are sympathetic
          to me." to your group.<br>
          <br>
          Maimara shrugs.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers to the group, "Mm.&nbsp; Is this one?"<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi group Yes.<br>
          You whisper, "Yes." to your group.<br>
          <br>
          Rinika smiles slowly, her eyes not lifting from the paper's
          surface.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread asks, "Has she by any chance confided anything else to
          you concerning any similar incidents to the ones in this
          trial?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara clears her throat.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers to the group, "They haven't done that good of
          a job in showing it.&nbsp; And I'm not sure how I can ask them
          without breaking procedure."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "Well..."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "Yes, and no.&nbsp; We have a long history, and
          there have been various incidents between us,
          involving...&nbsp; pain, and torture before.&nbsp; It started
          with my assisting Achillea in torturing Juspera for an
          incident that I was not involved in.&nbsp; I think she nailed
          Achillea to the siege engine in the Landing, but I'm not
          entirely sure."<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne cringes.<br>
          <br>
          Achillea nods to Maimara.<br>
          <br>
          Achillea points at Mnar.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Objection."<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi ysh I may have told her what Eryael promised Juspera
          too, I dunno. At any rate she does believe Juspera's being
          torn.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread glances at Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "You weren't a witness for that part, no?"<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Hearsay, your honor."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread chuckles.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread says, "A pity I cannot call myself to the stand."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread shrugs.<br>
          <br>
          Prospera stares off into space.<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "It's background."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara shrugs.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Another route, please."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "It's not one you witnessed, however."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread nods to Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          Mnar leans back.<br>
          <br>
          Maimara asks, "Then I will withdraw my last sentence?"<br>
          <br>
          Gahread asks, "Are there any incidents you yourself have
          witnessed, or ones Juspera has discussed with you?"<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Evelith touch your mind:<br>
          "Lovely elf."<br>
          <i>(Ev</i><i>elith is referencing how Eryael used to address
            Juspera.)</i><br>
          <br>
          Gahread cocks his head at Maimara.<br>
          <br>
          You feel the blood drain from your face.<br>
          <br>
          You focus your mind on Evelith and think:<br>
          "No."<br>
          Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas glances at you.<br>
          <br>

          Siwas smiles to herself.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread nods to Maimara.<br>
          <br>
          You close your eyes for a moment.<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "One just three nights ago."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "As... a matter of fact."<br>
          <br>
          Achillea smiles quietly to herself.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread says, "Please detail it for the education of the
          court."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "Well."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara clears her throat.<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Evelith touch your mind:<br>
          "Feigning innocence. You just run from yourself, lovely elf.
          Tell me, is your petal in your pocket?"<br>
          <br>
          Perigourd whispers, "considering you yourself have admitted
          that you did in fact "beat them up" why are we sitting through
          all this?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "I was resting in the garden, and a cry for help
          came into my mind."<br>

          Evelith smirks.<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "She could barely think... and when I saw her,
          one of her eyes was gone."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers, "It's as valid as what I asked Vonka for."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra nods to you.<br>
          <br>
          Maimara asks, "She'd been... staked out.&nbsp; By a crossbow
          bolt and... a misericord?"<br>

          Eponyne clenches her fist.<br>

          Cappurnicus nods to Gahread.<br>

          Ariafela tightens her grip on her forest green arrow.<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Evelith touch your mind:<br>
          "You keep Him with you. Where is your petal. I have mine, do
          you have yours?"<br>
          <br>
          You focus your mind on Evelith and think:<br>
          "If he comes, I'll kill him."<br>
          Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra glances at you.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi ysharra I did to her what Sepher did to me.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          You bite your lip.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers, "Blackmailing her?"<br>
          <br>
          Ariafela stares at you.<br>
          <br>
          You hang your head.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers, "You'd better tell me fast."<br>
          <br>
          Mekthros whispers to the group, "Even I did not know about
          this one."<br>
          <br>
          Prospera cocks her head at Ariafela.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Proceed, counselor."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread says, "So...staked out, blackmailed."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara nods to Gahread.<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Evelith touch your mind:<br>
          "He told you to fight him once, Juspera. Remember with Siwas,
          on the rooftop? What did you do?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "And she came to me, for help.&nbsp; And told me
          what happened, and swore me to secrecy."<br>
          <br>
          Ariafela slowly empties her lungs.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi ysharra I staked her down. Cut her eye, her leg, her
          arm, I cut her face, and I told her not to tell, or I'd tell
          everyone she was Sepher's whore.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Mekthros looks thoughtfully at you.<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "But... I told Juspera what I knew.&nbsp; And
          she tried to blackmail me, too."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Object to the blackmail term."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "It's still hearsay."<br>
          <br>
          Your jaw drops.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "It is."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread glances at Ariafela.<br>

          Gahread glances at Cappurnicus.<br>

          Maimara asks, "Okay.&nbsp; Manipulate?"<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne whispers, "Is what she says true?"<br>
          <br>
          You focus your mind on Evelith and think:<br>
          "I was scared..."<br>
          Roundtime 5 seconds.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Maimara... please."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread says, "That can be remedied, if person in question is
          willing...."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "I don't really know what else to call it."<br>
          <br>

          You whisper quietly to Eponyne.<br>

          You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>

          <br>
          Gahread asks, "Maimara, did the person you observed say that
          she had been threatened with repercussions for speaking out of
          the actions taken against her?"<br>
          <br>
          Eponyne whispers, "This whole thing really sickens me, Jusp."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "Yes."<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Evelith touch your mind:<br>

          <br>
          Gahread glances at Ysharra.<br>

          Ysharra whispers, "You're on trial for your life, and your
          freedom."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread seems to be waiting for something.<br>
          <br>
          Mekthros whispers, "Does Ariafela have a weakness?&nbsp;
          Something that can be used?"<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread shrugs.<br>
          <br>
          Mekthros whispers, "Something she does not wish known?"<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Leading, but..."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread asks, "Now, did Juspera speak of this incident
          afterwards?"<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "I take it you have some rationale?"<br>
          <br>
          Gahread says, "Background."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread smiles at Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra chuckles.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread says, "I'm sure you're familar with that rationale."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Of course."<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Evelith touch your mind:<br>
          "Tell them you can't help being his lovely elf. It'd be so
          much better for you if you simply admitted your black heart."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread glances at Maimara.<br>

          Alisaire shows Ariafela her forest green arrow.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          Mekthros whispers, "Is it effective enough to prevent her from
          taking the stand?"<br>
          <br>
          Gahread asks, "Any response?"<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          Gahread slowly says, "I see."<br>

          Mekthros whispers, "Then tell me, that I may make it so."<br>

          Gahread asks, "Any comments about possession, about not being
          in control of herself?"<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Evelith touch your mind:<br>
          "Then why do you give into the lust for pain? Why did you hurt
          them?"<br>
          <br>

          audience.)<br>

          <br>
          Maimara says, "She was very different than she normally
          is.&nbsp; Her voice was huskier... she posessed incredible
          strength."<br>
          <br>
          (Siwas steeples her fingers in front of her, watching
          thoughtfully.)<br>

          Jacina twists and wrings her ivory silk handkerchief with
          fretful motions.<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "She was not in control of herself.&nbsp; And
          when she regained control, she asked for people to stop her."<br>

          Rinika idly scrawls something on a page in her soft blue suede
          book.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread asks, "Being a cleric, you do have some experience
          with Arkati, spirits and magic of that sort. In your
          judgement, would you say she was possessed that night?"<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow.<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "I would say she was, but I would also say, I
          could not determine who, or why."<br>

          <br>
          Gahread asks, "Now, you also had a run in with Juspera during
          the night of the 26th, did you not?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "I did."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread says, "Please describe that encounter in brief for the
          court."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara closes her eyes for a moment.<br>
          <br>
          (Maimara cocks her head to one side.)<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "I was standing in the North Market, when
          Kinshack ran by.&nbsp; He saw me, and stopped.&nbsp; He
          grabbed my arm.&nbsp; He was very upset.&nbsp; He said he
          needed my help, and grabbed my hand."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "So, I followed him to the Solhaven Inn, up the
          stairs...&nbsp; into a door.&nbsp; I'm not entirely sure which
          one, we were walking so fast.&nbsp; I'm not sure what he
          wanted me to do... I think he wanted me to stop her."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara calmly says, "We entered the room, and Jacina was
          lying in a bloody mess on the floor, and Juspera was kind
          of... crouched over her.&nbsp; Covered in blood.&nbsp; She
          looked like a wolf that got hold of a fawn.&nbsp; She turned
          around, her eyes wild... and when she saw me, her arms
          dropped, and went slack."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "I grabbed ahold of my dagger, and stepped
          toward her... she abandoned Jacina, and jumped on the bed,
          cowering in the corner.&nbsp; Whimpering like a child.&nbsp;
          Kinshack took Jacina out... and I stayed with Juspera."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread asks, "Did Juspera do anything further?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "No."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "She cowered."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "I commanded her to stand down, and she did."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread asks, "How did the encounter end?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "She got bolder, as time went on... and I heard
          Mnar's thoughts touch mine, so I called him to come help
          me.&nbsp; I figured... they're friends.&nbsp; Maybe she'll
          listen to him.&nbsp; But she didn't.&nbsp; Eventually... she
          grew bolder, and came after me, but her fear won out and she
          went for the door."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread nods to Maimara.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread asks, "At any time, did she display anywhere close to
          the same inhuman degree of strength she did when she had been
          possessed?"<br>
          <br>
          Gahread says, "A simple yes or no will do."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Objection."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "No."<br>

          Gahread raises an eyebrow in Ysharra's direction.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Leading the witness.&nbsp; This isn't evidence,
          her strength?"<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "It's very important."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus asks, "What is your point, Counselor?"<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus raises an eyebrow in Gahread's direction.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread says, "I will arrive at it very shortly."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Very well."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread glances at Maimara.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread asks, "Did she ask to be stopped at any point?"<br>
          <br>
          Gahread quickly asks, "Did she seem to be distressed by her
          own actions when she was not engaged in direct combat?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara calmly says, "No.&nbsp; She told me to let her go,
          because she wasn't done."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "One queston at a time, counselor."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra smiles.<br>
          .<br>
          Maimara says, "In my humble opinion... Most certainly
          not.&nbsp; She seemed to be having a grand time.&nbsp; The
          only thing she was afraid of, was feeling pain herself."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread clearly asks, "Maimara, did she give any of the same
          signs that showed her to be possessed previously, on that
          night?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara shakes her head.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "How would Maimara know her state of mind?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "She showed none of the signs of
          possession.&nbsp; She was herself, through and through, albeit
          a bit shaky and excited.&nbsp; Moreover... I asked her what
          was wrong.&nbsp; I asked her several questions - if she was
          scared, or whatever.&nbsp; And she said no.&nbsp; She said she
          was hungry."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread glances at Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread clearly says, "I ask for physical signs."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread clearly says, "Not a judgement of mental state."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "I thought distressed was mental, usually."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Silly me."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Defense... Please attempt to keep a more
          professional composure."<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Siwas touch your mind:<br>
          "My, my, Juspera.. Ariafela. You certainly HAVE been busy,
          haven't you?"<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi gah K, half an hour spent on Maimara so far... needs
          to get wrapped up.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Gahread.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra smiles at Cappurnicus.<br>
          <br>
          (Siwas almost, but not quite, smirks.)<br>
          <br>
          (Maimara reaches a hand up to run the pad of her index finger
          along the upper curve of her collar.)<br>
          <br>
          Quinstol whispers to the group, "So, what about the
          objection?"<br>
          <br>
          Gahread asks, "Maimara, did she mention, at any time during
          your conversation, anything about possession at that time?"<br>
          <br>
          You hear the faint thoughts of Siwas touch your mind:<br>
          "I'd think you'd have TRIED not to maim anyone else until
          Ysharra tried to convince people you'd gone mad."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "No."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread says, "Then I have no further questions."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Gahread.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread takes a few steps back.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra whispers to the group, "Apparently I don't have one."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra shrugs.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread sits down.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Morgiest deeply says, "The Jantalarans attack. Pardon me
          friends, ah hae duties tae attend tae."<br>
          <br>
          Morgiest bows.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra strides a few steps forward.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra raises an eyebrow in Cappurnicus's direction.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Please, proceed."<br>
          <br>
          <a name="maimara2"></a>Ysharra asks, "You were with Juspera
          before the attacks occured, correct?"<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra nods to Maimara.<br>
          <br>
          Maimara asks, "Which attacks?"<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "On the 26th."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "The ones she's being charged with."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "I had talked to her for a bit."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Anything else happen?"<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "During or after that chat, that you saw?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "No."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "Nothing similar to that night in the sylvan
          village?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "Nothing."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "She didn't seem to blank out?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "No, she did not."<br>
          <br>
          (Kinshack touches Jacina's shoulder briefly and fixes Juspera
          with an emotionless stare for several moments before he
          hastily makes his way toward the door, his hand reaching for
          his weapon.)<br>
          <br>
          Kinshack removes a deadly black vultite claidhmore from in his
          vruul skin back-sheaths.<br>
          <br>
          Kinshack strides away moving out.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "So in your recollection, there are no
          similarities between the two incidents?"<br>
          <br>
          You blink at Maimara.<br>
          <br>
          Siwas says, "Objection, leading the witness."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "At all?"<br>
          <br>
          (Juspera opens her mouth, but then closes it again.)<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Counselors brought up the incident themselves."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "They are relevant to each other."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "This is true."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "The posession incident is basis for judgement
          on later incidents."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Proceed."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "I have my question already stated."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods.<br>
          <br>
          Rinika idly scrawls something on a page in her soft blue suede
          book.<br>
          <br>
          Rinika tilts her flower-trimmed hat back on her head.<br>
          <br>
          Gahread says, "And I believe she answered as well."<br>
          <br>
          Gahread nods to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra asks, "In your recollection, there were no
          similarities, at all, in Juspera's physical signs and
          behaviour?"<br>
          <br>
          Maimara says, "In what she did, yes.&nbsp; In how she did it,
          and how she *was*... no."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "Very well..."<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra smiles at Maimara.<br>
          <br>
          Ysharra says, "No more questions."<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus nods.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus says, "Thank you Maimara... please return to your
          seat."<br>
          <br>
          Maimara stands up.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi siwas Maimara took about 40 minutes.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Siwas.<br>
          <br>
          &gt;whi ysharra Maimara took about 40 minutes.<br>
          You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
          <br>
          (Maimara takes a seat on the far edge, close to the audience.)<br>
          <br>
          Maimara sits down.<br>
          <br>
          Cappurnicus asks, "Defense... you have your witnesses
          prepared?"</span></font>
