            The curator pauses for a second before saying, "ANSWER me
            this easy question with one word.&nbsp; Who founded The
            Order of Voln's first monastery?"&nbsp; The curator then
            smirks at you, waiting for your answer.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;think WHY do I keep getting this!<br>
            You project your thoughts out to all of your teammates...<br>
            <br>
            &gt;think Who founded Voln?<br>
            You project your thoughts out to all of your teammates...<br>
            <br>
            &gt;answer Fas'thr<br>
            The curator blinks at you in suprise before saying, "You are
            correct.&nbsp; Perhaps you are the type of clientele that
            would appreciate our museum.&nbsp; I certainly wouldn't have
            guessed it by the frog skin pouch you are wearing, but you
            may enter now."<br>
            <br>
            The curator steps to the side of the door, allowing you to
            pass.<br>
            [Class and Culture, Foyer]<br>
            Plush, pale blue carpeting covers the floor of the foyer,
            muffling the sound of footsteps and voices.&nbsp; A tall,
            polished silver stand in the center of the room holds a
            neatly lettered sign.&nbsp; Nine narrow hallways lead from
            this room, one to the modwir doors of the exit, and the
            remaining eight in different directions.<br>
            Also here: Anteb, Setzier, Armaxis<br>
            Obvious exits: north, south, east, west, northeast,
            northwest, southeast, southwest<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "We'll get you the blue key from the gnome
            again"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier reaches out and holds Armaxis's hand.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I was correct."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier clasps your hand tenderly.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "I want the gold key"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier clasps your hand tenderly.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier's group just went east.<br>
            [Class and Culture, Gold Room]<br>
            Golden trim decorates the white marble walls that enclose a
            plushly carpeted floor.&nbsp; Closest to the hallway stands
            a gilt-edged modwir table and a bright silken tapestry
            adorns one wall.&nbsp; Facing the tapestry from the opposite
            wall is an etched glass display case that hangs above a
            heavy gold stand holding a thick volume.&nbsp; A large
            gold-inlaid door completes the room.<br>
            Also here: Armaxis, Setzier<br>
            Obvious exits: west<br>
            <br>
            You say, "You're crazy Setzier."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Anteb just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier reaches out and holds Anteb's hand.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier begins drawing a faint, twisting symbol as he utters
            an arcane invocation in hushed tones...<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "How do we get the key off the gnome?"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier gestures.<br>
            Casually Setzier pushes his finger into his eye
            socket.&nbsp; After a moment to get proper leverage, he pops
            the eyeball from his skull, sending it tumbling in your
            direction.&nbsp; Suddenly a couple of small batlike wings
            pop from its bloody sides and it begins to hover just out of
            reach, looking about.<br>
            <br>
            The floating eye zips into the opening of the lock.&nbsp;
            Setzier seems to concentrate for a moment before announcing
            that he notices a hidden latching mechanism deep in the door
            lock.&nbsp; You ponder if you could use this&nbsp;
            information advantageously.&nbsp; The eye then returns next
            to P0.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "That's not buggy at all." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Aha."<br>
            <br>
            As you settle into the difficult task of picking the lock,
            you realize that this lock is far more complex than any you
            have encountered.&nbsp; It would be impossible to pick this,
            unless you could see the inner mechanisms of the lock in
            more detail.<br>
            <br>
            The floating eye moves over to Setzier for a few moments.<br>
            <br>
            You stare at nothing in particular.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier blinks at you.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier whispers to the group, "How did you get it to work?"<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "As you settle into the difficult task of
            picking the lock, you realize that this lock is far more
            complex than any you have encountered.&nbsp; It would be
            impossible to pick this, unless you could see the inner
            mechanisms of the lock in more detail." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier peers quizzically at Armaxis.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Armaxis is better than you."<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis whispers to the group, "She should be able to pick
            it now."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "You try."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier nods to Armaxis.<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis stares off into space.<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis whispers to the group, "I did it without anyone
            here."<br>
            <br>
            You stub your toe trying to kick the door!<br>
            <br>
            Setzier rubs his chin thoughtfully.<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis leaves Setzier's group.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier whispers to the group, "Weird."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier's group just went west.<br>
            [Class and Culture, Foyer]<br>

            Obvious exits: north, south, east, west, northeast,
            northwest, southeast, southwest<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "When Armaxis did it I didn't get the "you
            think you could use this knowledge" message." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "But i could open it." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier yells, "Ready?"<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "With you, I did get the knowledge, and I can't
            open it." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Anteb nods.<br>
            <br>
            You point at a team pin.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Setzier.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier whispers to the group, "So friggin buggy"<br>
            <br>
            Anteb says, "Go back"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "He says go back."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier's group just went east.<br>

            heavy gold stand holding a thick volume.&nbsp; A large
            gold-inlaid door completes the room.&nbsp; You also see a
            floating eye that is flying around.<br>
            Also here: Anteb, Setzier, Armaxis<br>
            Obvious exits: west<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis says, "Try now."<br>
            <br>
            Armed with the additional knowledge you didn't have before,
            you work on the lock with skill and speed.&nbsp; After a few
            minutes, the door unlocks with a loud *CLICK*.<br>
            <br>
            You stare at nothing in particular.<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis stares off into space.<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis just opened a large gold-inlaid door.<br>
            <br>
            Anteb says, "Hm"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier asks, "What, no gold key?"<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis joins Setzier's group.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier whispers to the group, "Ripoff!"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier's group just went west.<br>

            Setzier's group just went northwest.<br>
            [Class and Culture, Blue Room]<br>
            Several maoral podiums line the powder blue walls of this
            room, each one supporting a heavy tome.&nbsp; The books hold
            all manner of arcane knowledge from volumes of magical
            spells to texts describing the magical properties of various
            herbs.&nbsp; Incongruously, the walls are adorned with
            paintings of rogues, some picking the locks on doors and
            treasure chests while others are engaged in picking the
            pockets of unsuspecting marks.&nbsp; At the far end of the
            room is a black fel door inset with sapphires.&nbsp; You
            also see a shifty eyed gnome that is lying down.<br>
            Also here: Anteb, Armaxis, Setzier<br>
            Obvious exits: southeast<br>
            <br>
            Setzier asks the gnome something.<br>
            The shifty eyed gnome says loudly, "Yep!&nbsp; I found this
            here key just laying next to the door.&nbsp; I suppose you
            want it, too.&nbsp; Well, too bad!&nbsp; It's mine!"<br>
            <br>
            The gnome then tucks the key away in his vest.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier removes a yellowed scroll from in his leather bag.<br>
            <br>
            You laugh out loud!<br>
            <br>
            Setzier raises his yellowed scroll and gestures.<br>
            Sparks begin to fly between the yellowed scroll and
            Setzier's fingers.<br>
            With a sudden burst of enthusiasm, the sparks jump into
            Setzier's hand and he seems to glow with power.<br>
            <br>
            You slip your hand inside the gnomes vest and just barely
            touch the key inside before the gnome notices and jumps back
            facing you!<br>
            <br>
            The gnome says, "I don't think so!&nbsp; Keep your grubby
            hands off of my stuff!"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier gestures at a shifty eyed gnome.<br>

            A shifty eyed gnome suddenly slows all movements.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier points at a shifty eyed gnome.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "Steal."<br>
            <br>
            You slip your hand inside the gnomes vest and snatch the key
            from inside!&nbsp; The gnome then blinks, pats his vest, and
            scowls heavily at you.<br>
            <br>
            The gnome says, "Fine!&nbsp; I didn't want that dumb key
            anyways!&nbsp; It fits you in this snobby place!"<br>
            <br>

            Setzier points at Anteb.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "He wanted."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I have a key."<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis says, "Hmph."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Oh, he did?"<br>
            <br>
            Anteb says, "Its alright..."<br>
            <br>
            You offer your museum key to Anteb, who has 30 seconds to
            accept the offer.&nbsp; Type CANCEL to prematurely cancel
            the offer.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier nods to you.<br>

            Anteb says, "Keep it."<br>
            <br>
            Anteb has declined the offer.<br>
            <br>
            Anteb grins.<br>
            <br>
            Anteb exclaims, "Lets go!"<br>
            <br>
            You pretend to swallow the key while secretly putting it
            into your cloak.<br>

            Plush, pale blue carpeting covers the floor of the foyer,
            muffling the sound of footsteps and voices.&nbsp; A tall,
            polished silver stand in the center of the room holds a
            neatly lettered sign.&nbsp; Nine narrow hallways lead from

            a gilt-edged modwir table and a bright silken tapestry
            adorns one wall.&nbsp; Facing the tapestry from the opposite
            wall is an etched glass display case that hangs above a
            heavy gold stand holding a thick volume.&nbsp; A large

            The high, domed ceiling of the nexus is a pale blue to match
            the walls and carpet and has a cloudscape painted upon
            it.&nbsp; Eight doors of differing looks and textures lead
            into this room, though none of them have visible means of
            opening from this side.&nbsp; A bespectacled curator stands
            in the center of the room, where he can keep a careful eye
            on each of the doors.&nbsp; Eight hallways lead out of the

            Setzier's group just went northwest.<br>
            Armaxis's eyes glaze over suddenly, a distant expression
            passing across his face.<br>
            As you look around, an image appears before you.<br>
            <br>
            You know yourself to be Thyrsos Kanigel Faendryl, who is a
            sorcerer of little renown and fewer means.&nbsp; Though few
            of your peers pay attention to you, and commonly speak
            around you as though you're not there, you have wisely
            picked up many summoning secrets.&nbsp; If only you could
            summon a being that would make them look at you!&nbsp; You
            could finally become well known and respected.&nbsp; As you
            mull over this, you realize that again your cook has made
            asparagus for dinner, which you truly despise.&nbsp; You
            poke at them with your fork, and suddenly blink in
            surprise!&nbsp; The green vegetable spears seemed to have
            fallen into a pattern of lines, bringing to mind an
            idea.&nbsp; You quickly thrust the plate back, leap up, and
            go rummaging for your chalks and powders, sure that you will
            be known as a master summoner!<br>
            <br>
            The image fades then, leaving you pondering what happened
            next.<br>
            <br>
            [Class and Culture, Bare Chamber]<br>
            This relatively bare chamber has had its walls and floor
            painted a stark white color.&nbsp; A small witchwood stand
            and a brass candelabra, which flank the black witchwood
            door, are the only items of note in the room.&nbsp; Some
            intricate design has been chalked onto the floor, though it
            is smudged and marred in many areas.<br>
            Also here: Anteb, Armaxis, Setzier<br>
            Obvious exits: southeast<br>
            <br>
            Setzier exclaims, "Draw!"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier walks over and kicks you in the shin!<br>
            <br>
            Setzier exclaims, "Draw!"<br>
            <br>
            You help yourself to some multicolored chalk.&nbsp; Enjoy!!<br>
            <br>
            You begin to draw on the floor, completing and reforming the
            once smudged design.<br>
            Suddenly, the image continues.<br>
            <br>
            You carefully lie out your circle, drawing power along
            specific patterns, and cast your spell.&nbsp; A brilliant
            flash of light suddenly hits you, and before youstands a
            huge creature of which you are sure no Faendryl had ever
            seen before.&nbsp; Standing aghast, you frantically order it
            to return from whence it came.&nbsp; It gives a chilling
            smile in your direction, flexes its large wings, and
            disappears in a flash.&nbsp; Though you know the Patriarch
            requires all new summons to be recorded in the Enchiridion
            Valentia, you balk, and decide instead to say nothing to
            anyone about your fearful encounter.<br>
            <br>
            The image fades then, leaving you pondering what happened
            next.<br>
            <br>
            You kick Setzier!<br>
            <br>
            You put your chalk back on the stand.<br>
            Suddenly, the image continues.<br>
            <br>
            It is two weeks later and you ponder your summoning over a
            cup of tea.&nbsp; Suddenly a flash of light rips through
            your sitting room, and the fearsome beast is again standing
            before you!&nbsp; You quickly dive for cover, and hide under
            a table as the beast proceeds to tear your house to shreds,
            followed&nbsp; by your block and borough.&nbsp; Hours seemed
            like days as the beast continued its rampage, and only after
            the arrival of some accomplished sorcerers was the beast
            bound and destroyed.&nbsp; You are hauled before the
            Basilican sorcerers, and forced to reveal everthing you had
            done in great detail...sketching out the circle, the lines
            of powers, and the exact spell cast.&nbsp; Thinking you've
            finally become&nbsp; known, your glee is quickly replaced by
            horror&nbsp; as you are sentenced to death for the crime of
            failing to report your discovery immediately.&nbsp; You pale
            at your short-lived future, not even consoled by the fact
            that you were the first Faendryl to summon a demon.<br>
            <br>
            The image fades then, leaving you in pondering the history
            of the Faendryl.<br>
            A soft click can be heard from the door and it slowly swings
            open.<br>

            Murals painted on the walls of this room depict businesses
            and citizens in a bustling city square.&nbsp; The
            centerpiece of the murals is the image of an immense
            building with a banner over its thanot door proclaiming that
            it is "The Hanesyddol Museum of Ta'Loenthra."&nbsp; In the
            center of the room are two life-size statues, one of an
            elven bard playing his lute, and another of a group of
            dwarves listening to the performance.&nbsp; Near the bard
            stands a slender silver pedestal with an etched silver dish

            Polished maoral bookshelves are built into every wall of
            this room, with books neatly organized upon each.&nbsp; A
            ladder is built onto a track around the ceiling so that it
            can be wheeled to any point in the room to reach books on
            the upper shelves.&nbsp; Eight doors are spaced along the
            walls of the room.&nbsp; A heavy maoral desk is centered in
            the middle of the pale blue carpeting.&nbsp; A prim
            librarian sits at the desk, peering over the rim of her
            spectacles at any who enter.&nbsp; You also see a simple

            <br>
            You whisper, "Aramana could do it..." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Fleckle is a half-elf, so that's two races."<br>

            Setzier whispers to the group, "I'm not going ot be able to
            last an hour staying awake."<br>

            before I turn in."<br>

            Setzier whispers to the group, "Aramana not in game."<br>
            <br>
            You groan.<br>

            Anteb whispers to the group, "Staying then..."<br>

            <br>
            You whisper, "Anteb can read scrolls right? Do you have an
            eye spy scroll?" to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Anteb whispers to the group, "How high is that one?"<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "If we're sure Fleckle could do it with a
            scroll then I'd feel better about leaving for Teras myself."
            to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis whispers to the group, "7th Level."<br>

            You whisper, "707." to your group.<br>

            Anteb whispers to the group, "So can I go or do I need to
            stay?"<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "If Fleckle can't do it by scroll, and Aramana
            goes to bed, then maybe one of you can come back tomorrow or
            something... as horrid as that is..." to your group.<br>

            Setzier whispers to the group, "I can stay here in EN."<br>

            Setzier whispers to the group, "If he tells me when to meet
            up with him tomorrow"<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis whispers to the group, "Yeah, I just need to zip
            back from Teras quick."<br>

            You rub your chin thoughtfully.<br>
            <br>
            Charna just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier whispers to the group, "I'm officially done."<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "Whatever you like." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>

            Setzier whispers to the group, "So I don't need another."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier exclaims, "oh!"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier tries to pull Charna towards him.<br>
            <br>
            You snicker.<br>
            <br>
            Anteb whispers to the group, "I'll be on tomorrow... to
            help... Whoever checks the points send them to me?"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "I want to try something inside."<br>
            <br>
            Charna raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Charna says, "Uh.. okay."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier searches around for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier wandered down a pale stone walkway.<br>
            <br>
            Charna wandered down a pale stone walkway.<br>
            <br>
            [Class and Culture, Entrance]<br>
            A small, well kept building rests here behind the grand
            Royal Arboretum.&nbsp; A row of small maoral trees stands
            guard over the walkway leading to the structure.&nbsp; The
            only apparent entrance is a set of ornate modwir doors
            guarded by a stuffy looking curator.&nbsp; A small sign has
            been set into the ground to the right of the curator.&nbsp;
            You also see a stuffy looking curator.<br>
            Also here: Charna, Setzier<br>
            Obvious paths: none<br>
            <br>
            As Setzier approaches the doors the curator suddenly steps
            in front of them, blocking the way.&nbsp; Staring down his
            nose, the curator says, "Pardon me, sir, but we only allow
            intelligent, cultured people inside the Class and
            Culture.&nbsp; No need for the riff-raff coming in
            here.&nbsp; Perhaps if you proved yourself worthy by
            answering a simple question, I could allow you in, yes?"<br>
            <br>
            The curator pauses for a second before saying, "ANSWER me
            this easy question with one word.&nbsp; Who founded The
            Order of Voln's first monastery?"&nbsp; The curator then
            smirks at Setzier, waiting for his answer.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier answers his question with a long, drawn out answer.<br>
            <br>
            The curator rolls his eyes and glances at Setzier.&nbsp; He
            then says, "Don't quite follow directions very well, do
            you?&nbsp; ANSWER in one word only, please.&nbsp; One.&nbsp;
            You know...the first number you learned to count with?&nbsp;
            Or haven't you progressed to that point in your studies
            yet?"<br>
            <br>
            The curator squints at Charna as she approaches the
            doors.&nbsp; The curator then mutters, "One at a time,
            eh?&nbsp; I'm already talking to someone.&nbsp; Wait your
            turn, you lout!"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "Guess he didn't like that answer."<br>
            <br>
            Charna chuckles.<br>
            <br>
            The curator squints at Charna as she approaches the
            doors.&nbsp; The curator then mutters, "One at a time,
            eh?&nbsp; I'm already talking to someone.&nbsp; Wait your
            turn, you lout!"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier whispers, "answer Who cares?"<br>
            <br>
            Charna raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            You chuckle at Setzier.<br>
            <br>
            The curator looks at Setzier and taps his foot
            impatiently.&nbsp; Perhaps he better hurry up and answer his
            question.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier answers his question in one concise word.<br>
            <br>
            The curator sneers at Setzier before saying, "I didn't think
            you could handle that <br>
            easy question.&nbsp; Be away with you, riff-raff.&nbsp; Come
            back when you are a bit more <br>
            educated."&nbsp; He then waves a hand at Setzier, dismissing
            him indifferently.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier waves a hand at the ornate modwir doors, dismissing
            it indifferently.<br>
            <br>
            As you approach the doors the curator suddenly steps in
            front of them, blocking your way.&nbsp; Staring down his
            nose, the curator says, "Pardon me, madam, but we only allow
            intelligent, cultured people inside the Class and
            Culture.&nbsp; No need for the riff-raff coming in

            this easy question with one word.&nbsp; What was the name of
            Despana's Keep?"&nbsp; The curator then smirks at you,
            waiting for your answer.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;answer maelshyve<br>
            The curator blinks at you in suprise before saying, "You are
            correct.&nbsp; Perhaps you are the type of clientele that
            would appreciate our museum.&nbsp; I certainly wouldn't have
            guessed it by the cloak you are wearing, but you may enter
            now."<br>
            <br>
            The curator steps to the side of the door, allowing you to
            pass.<br>
            [Class and Culture, Foyer]<br>
            Plush, pale blue carpeting covers the floor of the foyer,
            muffling the sound of footsteps and voices.&nbsp; A tall,
            polished silver stand in the center of the room holds a
            neatly lettered sign.&nbsp; Nine narrow hallways lead from
            this room, one to the modwir doors of the exit, and the
            remaining eight in different directions.<br>
            Obvious exits: north, south, east, west, northeast,
            northwest, southeast, southwest<br>
            <br>
            [Class and Culture, Blue Room]<br>
            Several maoral podiums line the powder blue walls of this
            room, each one supporting a heavy tome.&nbsp; The books hold
            all manner of arcane knowledge from volumes of magical
            spells to texts describing the magical properties of various
            herbs.&nbsp; Incongruously, the walls are adorned with
            paintings of rogues, some picking the locks on doors and
            treasure chests while others are engaged in picking the
            pockets of unsuspecting marks.&nbsp; At the far end of the
            room is a black fel door inset with sapphires.&nbsp; You
            also see a shifty eyed gnome that is lying down.<br>
            Obvious exits: southeast<br>
            <br>
            &gt;ste gnome<br>
            And disturb another patron?&nbsp; Be civilized!<br>
            <br>
            &gt;think What'd you do to the gnome before to make it so I
            could steal from him?<br>
            You project your thoughts out to all of your teammates...<br>
            <br>
            The shifty eyed gnome stops to gaze at a painting, a look of
            confusion passing across his face.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;l paint<br>
            I could not find what you were referring to.<br>
            <br>
            You stare at nothing in particular.<br>
            <br>
            In imitation of other nearby patrons, the shifty eyed gnome
            holds his nose high in the air.&nbsp; After bumping into a
            podium, he quickly glances about to see if anyone noticed.<br>
            <br>
            You ask the gnome something.<br>
            The shifty eyed gnome says loudly, "Yep!&nbsp; I found this
            here key just laying next to the door.&nbsp; I suppose you
            want it, too.&nbsp; Well, too bad!&nbsp; It's mine!"<br>
            <br>
            The gnome then tucks the key away in his vest.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;think Oh.<br>
            You project your thoughts out to all of your teammates...<br>
            <br>
            You slip your hand inside the gnomes vest and just barely
            touch the key inside before the gnome notices and jumps back
            facing you!<br>
            <br>
            The gnome says, "I don't think so!&nbsp; Keep your grubby

            <br>
            &gt;think Ahh... you slowed him... and you're not a wizard.

            by a large glass cover.&nbsp; A small iron cage sits on the
            wall opposite the hallway next to an intricately carved
            maoral door.&nbsp; You also see a droopy-eyed puppy that is
            lying down.<br>
            Also here: Charna, Setzier<br>
            Obvious exits: northwest<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy glances forlornly at the small iron
            cage.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier points at a droopy-eyed puppy.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "pet that"<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy nudges the hand of Charna cautiously
            and glances towards the iron cage.<br>
            <br>
            Charna says, "He's sad."<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy mopes around.<br>
            <br>
            Charna kneels down.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy nudges the hand of Charna cautiously
            and glances towards the iron cage.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy leaps away from Charna and lets out a
            yelp!<br>
            <br>
            As Setzier leans towards the puppy, it cowers away in fear!<br>
            <br>
            Charna says, "I know."<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy glances forlornly at the small iron
            cage.<br>
            <br>
            You carefully begin to examine a small iron cage for
            traps...<br>
            <br>
            You discover no traps.<br>
            Roundtime: 17 sec.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy nudges the hand of Charna cautiously
            and glances towards the iron cage.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier blinks.<br>
            <br>
            As Setzier leans towards the puppy, it cowers away in fear!<br>
            <br>
            Setzier scowls.<br>
            <br>
            Charna glances at Setzier.<br>
            <br>
            You remove a diamond-edged black vaalin lockpick from in
            your cloak.<br>
            <br>
            You settle into the difficult task of picking the lock.<br>
            You make a miserable attempt (d100=12).<br>
            Your lockpick gets stuck in the lock!&nbsp; You carefully
            try to work it free but end up bending the tip!<br>
            Roundtime: 20 sec.<br>
            <br>
            Charna says, "Yer scarin' him."<br>
            <br>
            You stare at nothing in particular.<br>
            <br>
            The black vaalin lockpick looks slightly damaged.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy nudges the hand of Charna cautiously
            and glances towards the iron cage.<br>
            <br>
            (Setzier points at the key on the puppy.)<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "Get that."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "And hand it here."<br>
            <br>
            Charna removes the key from the collar of the droopy-eyed
            puppy.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy barks once at the small iron cage!<br>
            <br>
            Charna asks, "Hand it here?"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier mutters something about dogs..<br>
            <br>
            Setzier nods to Charna.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy barks once at the small iron cage!<br>
            <br>
            Setzier tries to pull Charna to her feet, but she is too
            heavy.<br>
            <br>
            Charna raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Charna stands up.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy glances forlornly at the small iron
            cage.<br>
            <br>
            Charna offers Setzier a small silver key.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier accepts Charna's small silver key.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier smirks.<br>
            <br>
            You hear a click as Setzier unlocks a small iron cage.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy glances forlornly at the small iron
            cage.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier just opened a small iron cage.<br>
            <br>
            Charna chuckles.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy nudges the hand of Charna cautiously
            and glances towards the iron cage.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier just opened a dark studded leather bag.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy barks once at the small iron cage!<br>
            <br>
            You see Setzier vonEvenlore.<br>
            He appears to be a Dark Elf.<br>
            He appears to be an adult and taller than average.&nbsp; He
            has brooding dark eyes and pale skin.&nbsp; He has long,
            unkempt black hair worn in a ponytail.&nbsp; He has a gaunt
            face, an aquiline nose and sharply-curved pointed ears.<br>
            He has a black jackal's head mark on his neck, and a band of
            dark sigils encircling his wrists.<br>
            He is in good shape.<br>
            He is holding a small silver key in his right hand.<br>
            He is wearing a team pin, a silver hoop earring, a mottled
            black spiny-tailed lizard, a dark myklian scale harness, a
            thin black steel talisman, a black rapture cloak, a crimson
            vaalin unholy symbol of Sheru, some well-oiled scuffed black
            leathers, an ornate blackened ora ring, a dark studded
            leather bag, a tightly-woven dark alloy belt, a pair of deep
            black leather pants adorned with silver studs around the
            waist, and a pair of shadowy black leather boots with
            slender eahnor clasps.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier put a small silver key in his leather bag.<br>
            <br>
            Charna asks, "Bone?"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier drags the dead puppy from out of the cage.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy mopes around.<br>
            <br>
            Charna gasps.<br>
            <br>
            Charna says, "Oh no..."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Ooh."<br>
            <br>
            Charna clasps her hand over her mouth.<br>
            <br>
            You reach out and touch the dead puppy.&nbsp; Yup, it's
            dead.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier whispers to the group, "Poke the puppy"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier whispers to the group, "Hehe"<br>
            <br>
            Stop harassing a dead puppy.&nbsp; How cruel!<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy mopes around.<br>
            <br>
            Charna asks, "Ye have a raise dead?"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier nods to Charna.<br>
            <br>
            Charna gazes at Setzier with a look of utter sorrow in her
            eyes.<br>
            <br>
            You grin.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier says, "Stop giving me those looks."<br>
            <br>
            Charna fidgets.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy barks once at the spotted puppy!<br>
            <br>
            Setzier removes an obscure scroll from in his leather bag.<br>
            <br>
            Charna reaches out and touches the dead puppy.&nbsp; Yup,
            it's dead.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier raises his obscure scroll and gestures.<br>
            Sparks begin to fly between the obscure scroll and Setzier's
            fingers.<br>
            With a sudden burst of enthusiasm, the sparks jump into
            Setzier's hand and he seems to glow with power.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier gestures at the spotted puppy.<br>
            A gigantic burst of magic explodes over the head of
            Setzier.&nbsp; He reels from the backwash of pure spiritual
            energy!<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Did you link with the puppy first?"<br>
            <br>
            Charna asks, "Leave where?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "We have to go to Teras."<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy mopes around.<br>
            <br>
            Charna says, "O"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier whispers to the group, "Don't tell me I have to link
            souls with it."<br>
            <br>
            Charna says, "Right."<br>
            <br>
            Charna nods to Setzier.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier raises his obscure scroll and gestures.<br>
            Sparks begin to fly between the obscure scroll and Setzier's
            fingers.<br>
            With a sudden burst of enthusiasm, the sparks jump into
            Setzier's hand and he seems to glow with power.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy lets out a small whine.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier gestures at the spotted puppy.<br>
            A silvery translucent thread extends from Setzier
            encompassing the puppy's corpse.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier scowls.<br>
            <br>
            Charna grins slowly.<br>
            <br>
            Charna says, "Thank ye."<br>
            <br>
            Charna gazes fondly at Setzier.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy nudges the hand of Charna cautiously
            and glances towards the brown spotted puppy.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier raises his obscure scroll and gestures.<br>
            Sparks begin to fly between the obscure scroll and Setzier's
            fingers.<br>
            With a sudden burst of enthusiasm, the sparks jump into
            Setzier's hand and he seems to glow with power.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier gestures at the spotted puppy.<br>
            Setzier concentrates for a moment then sighs weakly.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy barks once at the spotted puppy!<br>
            <br>
            Charna raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Charna frowns.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy mopes around.<br>
            <br>
            Charna looks downright miserable.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy lets out a small whine.<br>
            <br>
            Charna kneels down.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier raises his obscure scroll and gestures.<br>
            Sparks begin to fly between the obscure scroll and Setzier's
            fingers.<br>
            With a sudden burst of enthusiasm, the sparks jump into
            Setzier's hand and he seems to glow with power.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier gestures at the spotted puppy.<br>
            Setzier concentrates for a moment then sighs weakly.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy nudges the hand of Charna cautiously
            and glances towards the brown spotted puppy.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy lets out a small whine.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier whispers to the group, "Odd."<br>
            <br>
            Charna whispers to the group, "What?"<br>
            <br>
            Setzier whispers to the group, "Not letting me.&nbsp; Unable
            to gather enough strength"<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "I think that's because you already cast." to
            your group.<br>
            <br>
            Charna whispers to the group, "Wierd."<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "Now you need to wait." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy glances forlornly at the spotted
            puppy.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "Cleric thing." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier whispers to the group, "Hrmph"<br>
            <br>
            Charna whispers to the group, "I'm not getting this puzzle
            am I?"<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "Let's reset it, I want a silver key!" to your
            group.<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy mopes around.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "You have to wait anyway." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Charna whispers to the group, "For what?"<br>
            <br>
            The droopy-eyed puppy lets out a small whine.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "Till the penalty wears off and he can cast
            raise again." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier begins to twitch.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier tries to pull Charna to her feet, but she is too
            heavy.<br>

            <br>
            You say, "Yeah come on."<br>
            <br>
            Setzier's group just went northwest.<br>
            [Class and Culture, Foyer]<br>
            Plush, pale blue carpeting covers the floor of the foyer,
            muffling the sound of footsteps and voices.&nbsp; A tall,
            polished silver stand in the center of the room holds a
            neatly lettered sign.&nbsp; Nine narrow hallways lead from
            this room, one to the modwir doors of the exit, and the
            remaining eight in different directions.<br>
            Also here: Charna, Setzier<br>
            Obvious exits: north, south, east, west, northeast,
            northwest, southeast, southwest<br>
            <br>
            Charna frowns.<br>
            <br>
            Setzier's group went through a set of ornate modwir doors.<br>
            [Class and Culture, Entrance]<br>
            A small, well kept building rests here behind the grand
            Royal Arboretum.&nbsp; A row of small maoral trees stands
            guard over the walkway leading to the structure.&nbsp; The
            only apparent entrance is a set of ornate modwir doors
            guarded by a stuffy looking curator.&nbsp; A small sign has
            been set into the ground to the right of the curator.&nbsp;
            You also see a stuffy looking curator.<br>
            Also here: Charna, Setzier<br>
            Obvious paths: none<br>
            <br>
            Setzier's group wandered down a pale stone walkway.<br>
            [Ta'Illistim, Glamesine Var]<br>
            The var comes to an end in a pleasant little cul-de-sac,
            framed on three sides by blue-grey marble buildings.&nbsp;
            Several elves are taking advantage of the polished marble
            benches resting in the shelter of two dwarf maoral
            trees.&nbsp; In an open window high above the var, a pale
            golden light illuminates some blue and silver curtains that
            flutter in the gentle night breeze.&nbsp; You also see the
            Ta'Illistim Royal Arboretum.<br>
            Also here: Charna, Setzier, Agenais<br>
            Obvious paths: south<br>
            <br>
            Setzier searches around for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Agenais wandered down a pale stone walkway.<br>
            <br>
            Charna says, "Poor puppy."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;go walk<br>
            A strange force prevents you from doing that.&nbsp; Perhaps

            Setzier clasps Charna's hand tenderly.<br>

            Setzier whispers to the group, "Lost our instance."<br>

            [Class and Culture, Entrance]<br>
            A small, well kept building rests here behind the grand
            Royal Arboretum.&nbsp; A row of small maoral trees stands
            guard over the walkway leading to the structure.&nbsp; The
            only apparent entrance is a set of ornate modwir doors
            guarded by a stuffy looking curator.&nbsp; A small sign has
            been set into the ground to the right of the curator.&nbsp;
            You also see a stuffy looking curator.<br>
            Also here: Charna, Setzier<br>
            Obvious paths: none<br>
            <br>
            You let out a cheer!<br>
            <br>
            Setzier scowls.<br>
            <br>
            As Charna approaches the doors the curator suddenly steps in
            front of them, blocking the way.&nbsp; Staring down his
            nose, the curator says, "Pardon me, madam, but we only allow
            intelligent, cultured people inside the Class and
            Culture.&nbsp; No need for the riff-raff coming in
            here.&nbsp; Perhaps if you proved yourself worthy by
            answering a simple question, I could allow you in, yes?"<br>
            <br>
            The curator pauses for a second before saying, "ANSWER me
            this easy question with one word.&nbsp; River's Rest is set
            at the juncture of the western sea and what river?"&nbsp;
            The curator then smirks at Charna, waiting for her answer.<br>
            <br>
            The curator squints at Setzier as he approaches the
            doors.&nbsp; The curator then mutters, "One at a time,
            eh?&nbsp; I'm already talking to someone.&nbsp; Wait your
            turn, you lout!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Tempest."<br>
            <br>
            Charna answers her question in one concise word.<br>
            <br>
            The curator blinks at Charna in suprise before saying, "You
            are correct.&nbsp; Perhaps you are the type of clientele
            that would appreciate our museum.&nbsp; I certainly wouldn't
