            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Then we will move to closing arguments."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Prosecution, please proceed."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas clears her throat.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "The Defense admitted at the very beginning of
            this trial that Juspera Spintari did indeed attack the three
            people in question."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Following this, the Defense attempted to
            confuse the issue by bringing up a possession which most
            certainly did occur in Sylvarraend. They then brought up the
            potential for control of her by Draezir, Eryael, the Dark
            Alliance, Mekthros..."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas furrows her brow.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas scratches her head.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "I don't recall anyone else offhand."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "If the Defense had simply picked one cause and
            decided upon who actually gained control of Juspera's
            actions, I might even believe it myself. But other than
            trying to muddy the waters by casting a bit of blame
            everywhere, I see nothing that they've accomplished."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas glances at Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "One simple, stark fact remains. Juspera
            Spintari, by the admission of her own Defense, did commit
            the crimes she stands accused of. She did assault Xanthias
            with her dagger. She did repeatedly assault Vonka with her
            fists. She did attack and bloody Jacina."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka furrows her brow.<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros reclines casually in his seat.)<br>
            <br>
            Jacina leans softly against Kinshack.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers, "Are they together, now?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra raises an eyebrow in your direction.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "For this, she stands accused of two counts of
            aggravated assault, and one count of assault with intent to
            kill for her stabbing of Xanthias."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ysharra No. Not really. I think they wish they could
            be, but Jacina has Bartain.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "All you, the jury, must decide is whether or
            not those charges are true or not. All else is extraneous."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Thank you."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas sits down.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Defense, proceed."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra curtsies to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Been a long night, eh?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I'm sure you're all wanting to get to
            deliberations, so I'll be brief as possible."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "All of what Siwas said is correct, Juspera
            does indeed have a history of violence."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "But as you've all heard testimony about, it's
            not just her directing it to people.&nbsp; But against her."<br>
            <br>
            You shift your weight.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It seems clear to me that she was singled out
            just for these reasons."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "By the Alliance.&nbsp; By the Priests."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Especially Draezir, who knows fear so very
            well."<br>
            <br>
            Rinika idly scrawls something on a page in her soft blue
            suede book.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And they manipulated her, used bits and
            pieces of her history against her."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "So she would live through the horrors of her
            childhood, the horrors of her torture at our hands, and
            theirs...over and over again."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "As I said, yes, I do not argue that she did
            these crimes."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "But I do think that she had...reasonable
            questions to her control at the time."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And as such, remember this."<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela rolls her eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias grits his teeth.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You all must be absolutely certain, if you
            decide on a guilty vote."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You must examine everything you've heard."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne whispers to the group, "(Ysharra's a regular Johnny
            Cochran!)"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And you must be thoroughly convinced that
            there is -no- reasonable doubt in your mind."<br>

            <br>
            Siwas gazes heavenward.<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack shakes his head.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Thank you."<br>
            <br>
            Divid frowns.<br>

            Quinstol whispers to the group, "(Haha)"<br>
            <br>
            Genivie glances at Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "The jury will now move to deliberation."<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Mekthros echo in your mind:<br>
            "The trial phase for that of Juspera Spintari is concluded."<br>
            <br>
            Songowl nods.<br>
            <br>
            Songowl stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "Thank god."<br>
            <br>
            Songowl groans.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Mekthros echo in your mind:<br>
            "The jury deliberates in the Trading Post, the verdict not
            yet decided."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "This is going to take
            hours."<br>
            <br>
            (Songowl snap, crackles and pops as he leads the jury away.)<br>
            <br>
            (Rinika stretches slowly from where she sits, extending her
            limbs to their fullest.)<br>
            <br>
            Songowl's group just went out.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "I will call a recess while they do so."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "Hrmph.&nbsp; I'm not so sure
            about that."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I could use a drink."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Notification will be made via the thought
            amulet when a decision has been made."<br>
            <br>
            (Much stretching and whispering.)<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne whispers to the group, "Good job, everyone."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "Yes, good job,
            everyone.&nbsp; Thank you."<br>

            Prospera's group went up a curving staircase.<br>
            [Trading Post, Upstairs Hallway]<br>
            A faded, fraying carpet pads the center of the floor in this
            hall.&nbsp; Oil lamps hang at odd intervals on the walls,
            providing patchy, flickering light.&nbsp; You also see a
            modwir door, a curving staircase and an ash door.<br>

            Cappurnicus came through an ironbound oak door.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus asks, "Prospera has left?"<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "The jury knows what to do?"<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "I will have someone retrieve you when the
            decision has been made."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus shakes his head, clucking his tongue.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus gestures while calling upon the lesser spirits
            for aid...<br>
            Cappurnicus gestures.<br>
            Mekthros is discovered by Cappurnicus!<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Get out."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros quietly says, "I will see you shortly."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros went through an ironbound oak door.<br>

            Quinstol asks, "Are you okay?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I promised I would take what comes."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "So I noticed."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Even if it's not already decided."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I don't... uh... I don't... remember some of what
            happened on the stand."<br>
            <br>
            Your cheeks take on a slightly flushed tone.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol says, "Don't worry, neither do I."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ysh Sunburst to check for Mekthroses?<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra makes a nearly imperceptible motion while whispering
            a soft phrase...<br>
            Ysharra gestures.<br>
            A sudden burst of bright light emanates from Ysharra's hand!<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It's just us."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "There are a lot of things I would have seen
            go better."<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol nods to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "But really not so bad..."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It was just a little confusing in points."<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol says, "We needed more recesses."<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And it was a shame I couldn't call either of
            you."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne says, "Good gods, yes."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I would have wished you more time to prepare, and
            to call witnesses. But justice delayed is justice denied."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I'm sure Siwas felt the same way about her
            side."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I didn't even recognize most of the jury, that is
            good."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Surely they will be fair."<br>
            <br>
            You tremble.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra paces back and forth.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I don't have my handkerchief..."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus gives a slight flick of his wrist, and a dark
            crimson silk handkerchief suddenly appears in his hand!<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus offers Ysharra a dark crimson silk handkerchief.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Then you think a guilty-ah, thank you."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra accepts Thrassus's silk handkerchief.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles warmly at Thrassus, and raises the silk to
            her eyes, pressing the cool fabric to her irritated skin.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Jacina was the difficult one, I believe."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I didn't even think she'd be here."<br>
            <br>
            You bite your lip.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi quin You asked the other night if Thrassus opposed
            the dark alliance.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Quinstol.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi quin He supports them.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Quinstol.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol says, "If I didn't have a better understanding of
            these events, I can imagine I might very well be quite
            confused about what happened if I were on the jury."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus says, "Vonka's small outburst was definately
            harmful."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus says, "Even if the Overseer said to ignore it, it
            will be in the jurors' minds."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I think people will still remember her
            listing off all the things that were done."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Why aren't you praying?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I was."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Then Mekthros interrupted me."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus smirks.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol asks, "Why did Atoyoz keep smiling?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "She wants Juspera to hang."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I believe she's in love with Xanthias."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra paces back and forth.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Though the friends of hers that I hurt do not want
            to see me hang. Maybe Atoyoz wants it all the more for
            them."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Because they... are meek."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus asks, "Meek, hrm?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Do you ever get the impression that the world
            is a very different sort of place than your senses tell
            you?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            You blink at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You walk about and throw around these
            declarations of judgement like some arbiter of absolute
            Elanthian truth."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra glares at you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "The truth is out there."<br>
            <br>
            You cringe.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What in the pales gives you that power?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It is not power."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "What makes you always right?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra exclaims, "It is so!"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It is just what I think."<br>
            <br>
            You stare at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "And what do you do when someone disagrees?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Sometimes we must make decisions based on what we
            know."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra folds her arms over her chest.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "They will not always be right. But if we never
            moved to act, fearing a mistake, nothing would ever get done
            at all."<br>
            <br>
            You fold your arms over your chest.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And sometimes we make them based on what's
            opinion."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne sighs.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "You can't always have the facts."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Done?&nbsp; You mean like this trial, for
            example?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "This is justice?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra takes a drink from her sandfire liquor.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne says, "This whole thing was quite ridiculous if you
            ask me...no offense t' any involved."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It is my gift."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It's a poor one.&nbsp; But maybe the best
            we're capable of."<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol says, "I participate not because I have any real
            faith in this procedure, but because, well, if I didn't, I'd
            have even less faith in it."<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol shrugs.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra leans against a tanik door.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I have apologized to him that it might be a poor
            one."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne asks, "Him?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But if there will be justice... it must start
            somewhere."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Koar."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "But justice mishandled is no justice at all."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It's just...punishment."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "With a little speculation."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But it is better to make an attempt and mishandle
            it than to make no attempt."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "How so?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "How is it any better?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Tell me that, Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "If you don't attempt, there is no chance."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Didn't we go over your reasons why?"<br>
            <br>
            You blink at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Didn't we talk and talk and talk about the
            reasons why?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "And yet we still did it anyway."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You punished us and we punished you."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Was that justice?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Or was that just madness?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Madness."<br>
            <br>
            A sharp knocking sound emanates from a tanik door.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Cappurnicus touch your mind:<br>
            "It is time."<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol glances at a tanik door.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra unlatches a tanik door.<br>
            <br>
            You stand back up.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It's time."</font></span></font><font
