            You say, "It's time."<br>
            <br>
            [Trading Post, Foyer]<br>
            The foyer is decorated with banners from nearby
            cities.&nbsp; A large, pine desk sits in one corner of the
            room.&nbsp; Near the entrance, a rickety podium, covered
            with a thick layer of dust, stands to greet visitors.&nbsp;
            Chairs and tables, clearly not often used, are placed at
            intervals along the unadorned wooden walls.&nbsp; You also
            see an ash wood arch with a small wooden sign on it, a thick
            canvas curtain and a curving staircase.<br>
            Also here: Quinstol, Eponyne, Thrassus, Lady Ysharra,
            Kinshack, Lady Jacina, Perigourd, Xanthias who is sitting,
            Rhyshadow, Lecea, Songowl, Lumaco, Genivie<br>
            Obvious exits: out<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus came down a curving staircase.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus walks to stand behind a rickety podium.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi capp Will you announce the end to the recess over
            the net?<br>
            You whisper quietly to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the faint thoughts of Cappurnicus echo in your
            mind:<br>
            "The jury's decision has been made.&nbsp; Any who wish to
            witness, please return to the Trading Post."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias groans.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias takes a drink from his red Vornavian wine.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias asks, "Mnh?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "Please, please behave."<br>
            <br>
            Mnar's group just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "If not, death."<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne glances at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "I believe that is adequate time."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread's group just arrived.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar asks, "Shouldn't the prosecution be here?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods to Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "We should be. Thank you for asking."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas takes a drink from her ice blossom brandy.<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus snickers.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus asks, "Foreman, what has the jury found?"<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus glances at Songowl.<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "we, the jury, have reached a unanimous
            descision regarding all three counts."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela turns an inquisitive ear towards Songowl.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra touches you.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne bites her lip.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina rests a gentle hand on Kinshack's arm.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol fidgets.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "Juspera, I hope you are
            prepared for travel."<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias sits up straighter in his chair, only leaning a
            little bit to one side.)<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers, "Are you scared?"<br>
            <br>
            Jacina breathes very slowly and looks much calmer.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ysh I'll be more scared at the sentencing.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            (Maimara folds her arms across her chest and leans against
            the wall.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros fades into visibility.<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "for charges levied regarding the
            incident involving Jacina Purpleheart.."<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "..we find the defendant guilty of
            criminal assault"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias stares at Songowl.<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela slowly empties her lungs.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas slowly empties her lungs.<br>
            <br>
            Maimara grins smugly.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina lets out a sigh of relief.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias leans to his left slightly.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne closes her eyes for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol sighs.<br>
            <br>
            Achillea smiles slightly<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias wobbles, looking a bit faint.<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "for charges levied regarding the
            incident involving Vonka Yvanke.."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas moves to stand behind Jacina.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas hugs Jacina.<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack smiles with a twitch of his lips.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi capp lol... is that our definition of simple
            assault, or aggravated assault<br>
            You whisper quietly to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "we find the defendant guilty of
            Aggravated assault"<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias squints at Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Jacina smiles at Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne sways back and forth.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne sits down.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus whispers, "Simple, apparently."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "I've failed..."<br>
            <br>
            (Mekthros strides quietly to Juspera's left, standing just
            behind.)<br>
            <br>
            (Eponyne presses one hand to her forehead.)<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol whispers to the group, "It's not over yet."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "We shall see."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers to the group, "The sentence decides all."<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "for charges levied regarding the
            incident involving Xanthias Ostlander.."<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "You entered this with a different goal than
            me, I think." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "You may have failed. But you have not failed
            me." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Quinstol smiles slightly at Juspera.<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "we find the defendant guilty of
            aggrevated assault, but NOT with intent to kill as
            previously prescribed"<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne blinks.<br>
            <br>
            You slowly and deliberately empty your filled lungs.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers to the group, "You wanted this.&nbsp; Don't
            try change that."<br>
            <br>
            Genivie raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias gets an odd look on his face for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas gets an odd look on her face for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            You whisper, "Two charges were lessened." to your group.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "Thank you."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra smiles.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Indeed.&nbsp; Thank you."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus whispers, "Yes, you have gotten your martyrdom in a
            fashion."<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas glances at Juspera out of the corner of her eye.)<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "This concludes the hearing.&nbsp;
            Sentencing will be decided via committee."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera lets her head bow, little more than a slight flush
            on her face.)<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Cappurnicus, I would request a day to submit my
            recommendations for the sentence."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "I.. really ought to sleep first."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas coughs.<br>
            <br>
            (Jacina moves to stand between Siwas and Kinshack.)<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar says, "The committee, likewise, would love a day to
            rest."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "The committee will have time to consider
            the options."<br>
            <br>
            Alisaire quietly says, "Agreed."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra mutters under her breath.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I suppose the defense's travel plans will
            wait."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka bites her lip.<br>
            <br>
            A cold shiver runs up your back and you tremble ever so
            slightly.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka asks, "Dun' us git any say?"<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi capp I dunno, you want the victims to be able to
            make pleas at a sentencing hearing? Can't recall if they do
            that in real life or not.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Cappurnicus.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You already had your say."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas moves to stand behind you.<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "duly note that the aggrevated assault
            finding for the incident involving Vonka is an escalation of
            the previously prescribed criminal assault"<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas leans down slightly.)<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne whispers, "I hope this is what you wanted."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas whispers, "Worry turned to fear, yet?"<br>
            <br>
            You close your eyes for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I will take what comes."<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus whispers, "Errrgh."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "I had noted that."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Did I have any reason to be here, Juspera?"<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne glances at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Could you say one more time that you're
            waiting for punishment?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "No."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I told you what I wished."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You did and you didn't."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka wrings her hands.<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack says, "Why of course.&nbsp; To make appearances
            that Juspera's guilt in these crimes, and the punishment
            thereof, didn't serve the dark alliance."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "You left out a great deal.&nbsp; And you know
            that."<br>
            <br>
            Maimara says, "We all left out a great deal."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And you may say my god is rot, and that he has
            never worked through you, but I say he has worked through
            you as surely as you say your god has worked through me."<br>
            <br>
            Maimara says, "But a fraction of her deeds condemned her."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra chuckles.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas asks, "I think Vonka wished to say something.. Vonka?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "If that's so, then where the hell is he,
            now?"<br>
            <br>
            Gahread says, "Your god? I wasn't aware you followed one,
            Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Why would he have to wait on sentencing?"<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "if I may also add something.."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka says, "I dun' wan' Juspera punished."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias nods to Vonka.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra folds her arms over her chest.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "You know why I did this. Because some justice is
            better than none. Because I cannot ask for it without
            undergoing it myself."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "It doesn't matter, Vonka.&nbsp; Koar wants
            her punished."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And I did not submit myself to simple punishment
            exactly because of the worries of martyrdom."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "She's telling us that right now."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra points at you.<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "for a greater part of the trial, the
            jury as a whole had.. great reservations concerning the
            representation of the defense"<br>
            <br>
            Perigourd says, "this isn't justice"<br>
            <br>
            Perigourd smirks.<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "I ask that those on the committee keep
            their positions unknown from the public.&nbsp; I will speak
            to you soon."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "Is that so?"<br>
            <br>
            Vonka says, "I dun' wan' 'er punished."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka says, "I wan' 'er helped."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra asks, "You had issue with the job I did?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Then you try to do it."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "I'm afraid ve don't get a say in it, miss
            Fonka."<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "I wasn't asked"<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne says, "The jury should've been impartial. Period."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Try arguing for someone who doesn't want to
            be exonerated."<br>
            <br>
            Maimara says, "The jury was impartial."<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "completely impartial"<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne says, "But the representation should not be in
            question."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra folds her arms over her chest.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne mutters under her breath.<br>
            <br>
            Songowl softly says, "it was a technical reservation,
            eponyne"<br>
            <br>
            Maimara says, "It matters little.&nbsp; What was brought to
            light was the truth."<br>
            <br>
            Maimara says, "No matter who asks the questions, the answers
            are still the same."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I believe I will go to Ta'Illistim."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Good night, everyone."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra turns to face you.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I still mean what I say."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "I hope I never see you again."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Lady Ysharra just went out.<br>
            <br>
            You close your eyes for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne whispers, "You remember what that witch is sayin'
            about you...that Maimara."<br>
            <br>
            Maimara asks, "Who what?"<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne scowls at Maimara.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi epo Maimara... she lied on the stand... why?<br>
            You whisper quietly to Eponyne.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne whispers, "Why do you think?! Don't be such a fool.
            They've blinded you to the truth."<br>
            <br>
            You shake your head.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne shifts her eyes to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I knew. I knew it would be imperfect justice. But
            it is better than none."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros quietly says, "So it is."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Come not by my decision, but worked through the
            minds and hands of men."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "It's better justice than some of us accused of
            crimes have had in this town."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "Or ozer towns, Sivas, let's not forget."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias takes a drink from his red Vornavian wine.<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias drops another empty wine bottle on the floor.)<br>
            <br>
            Fremie asks, "you admitted your guilt in attacking
            them...eh?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I admitted to doing it."<br>
            <br>
            Achillea says, "She wanted to serve Koar by having a trial."<br>
            <br>
            Achillea smirks.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I didn't... trust myself to say I bore full
            responsibility. It seemed to serve Mularos too much, to be
            too much martyrdom."<br>
            <br>
            Achillea says, "I guess serving Koar never entered her mind
            while committing the crimes."<br>
            <br>
            You take a deep breath.<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack says, "I'm sure she had lots of friendly anxious
            help."<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack smiles.<br>
            <br>
            You belt out, "I can't even get through the day without--"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros quietly asks, "Did it of her own volition, you
            think?"<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera turns around and buries her fist in the wall.)<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros quietly says, "That would be naive."<br>
            <br>
            Lumaco says, "Ah innocent Achillea, pure as the new snow."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros quietly says, "She had help."<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "How am I supposed to decide... anything?"<br>
            <br>
            Gahread tilts his head up.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas nods to Gahread.<br>
            <br>
            Gahread glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Anything, anything?"<br>
            <br>
            Maimara asks, "Must we argue?"<br>
            <br>
            Maimara says, "She has been tried, and judged."<br>
            <br>
            Maimara asks, "Isn't that enough?"<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias gets unsteadily to his feet.)<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka strides over to stand before you.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias leans to his left slightly.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias suddenly stumbles for no apparent reason.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka peers quizzically at you.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka hugs you.<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros looks thoughtfully at Vonka.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka whispers, "It be done."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "For what it's worth, I'll likely recommend some
            sort of rehabilitation over something punitive."<br>
            <br>
            Lumaco says, "She seems repentant to me."<br>
            <br>
            Maimara says, "I really don't care."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "You need help, Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Even I can see that."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka whispers, "Whutever happened it be done."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas shakes her head.<br>
            <br>
            Maimara says, "She needs a spanking."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Either I am taking people's fate in my hands and
            that's bad, or I'm not taking it in my hands and that's bad
            too... either I'm steeping in the guilt and that's
            martyrdom, or I'm asking others to decide if I should bear
            it, and that's... martyrdom..."<br>
            <br>
            Achillea says, "See how repentent she is when she does it
            again."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I..."<br>
            <br>
            Gahread asks, "My thoughts exactly. After all, it worked for
            Setzier, right?"<br>
            <br>
            Maimara whispers, "Or you're lost, and you cannot find your
            way."<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack says, "Lose lose lose scenario."<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack says, "Can't please anyone."<br>
            <br>
            Kinshack snaps his fingers.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "If you want to be a martyr so badly, I can
            recommend you be burned at the stake."<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela whispers, "Why didn't ye ask ta have yer torture of
            me added ta the charges then? Are ye goin' ta ask fer a
            trial on that?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "I hear if you do it on the Hangman's Bridge
            here, the flames can be seen almost from South Haven."<br>
            <br>
            Perigourd says, "you would know"<br>
            <br>
            Perigourd nods to Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas scowls at you.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas gets an odd look on her face for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Rhyshadow says, "Sentencing is in the hands of the
            commitee.&nbsp; The rest of us have done our jobs.&nbsp;
            Knowing I have weighed only what was presented in this room
            will let me sleep soundly."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ariaf It was too late, they did not have time to
            interview you.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ariafela.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka says, "Juspera. Yer made yer peace wit' Koar."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "It's all right, Juspera.&nbsp; Zey'fe
            tainted your gift to Koar just as ve'fe all tainted
            Lorminstra's sword."<br>
            <br>
            Vonka says, "Whutever happens."<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias slurs and lists a little.)<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias gets an odd look on his face.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias waves his hand in a dismissive gesture.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne sighs deeply.<br>
            <br>
            Eponyne just went out.<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela stares at you.<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias asks, "Vhat did you expect?"<br>
            <br>
            Cappurnicus says, "I will take my leave.&nbsp; If any have
            questions of me, I can answer them later."<br>
            <br>
            You look at Ariafela blankly, at a loss to express yourself.<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela whispers, "They would hae if ye'd gone ta them the
            next day."<br>
            <br>
            (Ariafela gives Juspera a look of disgust.)<br>
            <br>
            You shake your head.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros quietly says, "The thief has finally done
            something... good."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ariaf Did you want me tried? For what I did to you?
            Or do you only want to see Sepher tear me apart again?<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ariafela.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka reaches out and holds your hand.<br>
            <br>
            You shake your head.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I don't know."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros quietly says, "I never thought I would see the
            day."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "But I did it, because it was better than not doing
            it."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas takes a drink from her ice blossom brandy.<br>

            You whisper quietly to Lumaco.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi luma Evelith.<br>
            You whisper quietly to Lumaco.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers, "Ah, but it is not justice to place your
            fate in the hands of others?"<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers, "I think... that it is quite possibly
            just that."<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela whispers, "By yer own defense's theory I should be
            able ta torture ye or some other innocent now. Because of
            what ye did ta me."<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi ariaf The defense theorized that I was being
            controlled. The jury ruled I wasn't. Are you being
            controlled?<br>
            You whisper quietly to Ariafela.<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela whispers, "Aye.. and tightly at the moment by
            Imaera. And me hatred of violence. Fortunately fer ye."<br>
            <br>
            Ariafela whispers, "Ye were nae controlled. And ye and I
            know it. Ye hurt me because ye enjoyed it. Ye wanted revenge
            on Sepher."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers, "Their words change nothing."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers, "Yet tonight, I feel you have changed."<br>
            <br>
            You blink at Mekthros.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka says, "Juspera. I t'ink yer dun right."<br>
            <br>
            (Xanthias slumps, slightly drunkenly, in his chair.)<br>
            <br>
            Lumaco whispers, "Why didn't you just say hello? What about
            her?"<br>
            <br>
            &gt;whi lumaco I knew she'd just be angry. But I just wanted
            to see her smiling again, see her act normal, with you and
            Xanthias...<br>
            You whisper quietly to Lumaco.<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers, "And I like it not.&nbsp; But, if that is
            your destiny, unfortunate for me as it is."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros whispers, "Little can... stop you."<br>
            <br>
            Mekthros sighs bitterly.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I guess... no matter what is said, none of
            those... words change what happened. My god knows. If I did
            wrong, then I did. And if I did right..."<br>
            <br>
            You rub your eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Vonka says, "T'ough I be skert o' who gonner git ter judge
            yer."<br>
            <br>
            Lumaco whispers, "For what it's worth Juspera, I think
            you're very brave. I don't think I'd be ever able to own up
            to my crimes, and it's horrible that all these people...
            these people who have done much worse..."<br>
            <br>
            Xanthias says, "You did your best, miss Juspera."</font></span></font><font
