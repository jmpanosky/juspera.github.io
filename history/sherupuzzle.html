            [Vipershroud, A Large Cave]<br>
            The tunnel opens up into a large granite cave.&nbsp; On one
            wall is a carving that looks like a celestial diagram of
            some sort.&nbsp; Imbedded into the carving are seven stars
            fashioned from gems.&nbsp; Near the carving is an altar of
            rough granite covered by a scorched and mildewed crimson
            cloth edged in gold, a crimson-bound journal lies open at
            its base.&nbsp; A draft swirls through the area, carrying
            with it the sounds of voices whispering urgently.&nbsp; An
            occasional bone-chilling scream of anguish pierces the room.<br>

            Written on the inside cover in an elegant script are the

            <br>
            You push the sunstone star and you hear a slight *click*.<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly, your vision fades and the air is filled with
            piercing cries of agony.<br>
            Interspersed with the screams you hear a voice reciting.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a toad, a snake, a rat,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; While kneeling on my prayer mat.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a rat, a toad, a snake,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; and spared them all, for Sheru's sake.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a snake, a rat, a toad,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; waiting as my heartbeat slowed.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; A toad, a snake, a rat saw me,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; when I was dead as dead could be,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; and ate me without sympathy.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; As your vision clears and the air quiets, you
            discover you are not where you were.<br>

            Light filtering down through a small trapdoor accessed by a
            set of rickety wooden steps lights the small cellar.&nbsp;
            The dirt walls and floor are bare except for the occasional
            errant root and a small drain in the center of the
            floor.&nbsp; A wadded mass of mildewed canvas bags lies in
            one corner, the sour smell of rotting canvas pervading the
            room.<br>

            Siwas smiles at you.<br>

            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            A lanky coyote growls and takes a large bite from Siwas's
            neck!<br>
            <br>
            You shudder.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "I'd rather NOT be eaten by coyotes..ow."<br>

            You exclaim, "Get her!"<br>

            You grin like an idiot.<br>

            You close your eyes for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            As a scraggly coyote takes a chunk out of you, it suddenly
            gets an odd expression on its its face, twitches, then falls
            over stone dead!&nbsp; The rest of the pack sniffs at it,
            then runs whimpering down the hillside.<br>

            rough granite covered by a scorched and mildewed crimson
            cloth edged in gold, a crimson-bound journal lies open at
            its base.&nbsp; A draft swirls through the area, carrying
            with it the sounds of voices whispering urgently.&nbsp; An
            occasional bone-chilling scream of anguish pierces the room.<br>

            [Icy Pool]<br>
            A thick layer of ice forms the walls and ceiling of the
            cavern, causing them to sparkle even in the dim light.&nbsp;
            Small chunks of ice float in the frigid water.&nbsp; Water
            drips from the icy ceiling in a series of syncopated dulcet
            tones that combine with the hollow clinking of the floating
            ice to create a strangely musical echo.<br>

            warm up soon!<br>

            You glance at Armaxis.<br>
            <br>
            You remove a wooden matchbox from in your fishnet satchel.<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis shivers with cold as the water laps around his body.<br>
            <br>
            You get a match from your wooden matchbox.<br>
            <br>
            You light the match by flicking it against your thumb.<br>
            <br>
            You put a wooden matchbox in your fishnet satchel.<br>

            (Juspera holds the match pathetically under an icicle, then
            under her own hand.)<br>

            Siwas shivers with cold as the water laps around her body.<br>

            Your burning match just burned out.&nbsp; It disappears in a

            Poor baby!<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "What!"<br>

            Siwas says, "It's cold in here."<br>

            Armaxis shivers with cold as the water laps around his body.<br>
            <br>
            You jump and scream like a madwoman and altogether feel
            rather silly.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas whispers to the group, "I actually dunno if you can
            solve this one yourself.. can she, Armaxis?"<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis shivers with cold as the water laps around his body.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "What happens when you cast fire spirit?"<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Hang on."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas murmurs a simple, mystical chant...<br>
            Siwas' right arm looks better.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas utters a light chant and raises her hands, beckoning
            the lesser spirits to her aid...<br>
            <br>
            Siwas hurls a ball of fire at you, setting you on
            fire!&nbsp; The flames flicker and dance around your body,
            lighting up the chamber with an eerie glow.&nbsp; The heat
            from the fire warms the pool and causes water to run down
            the walls of the cavern in rivulets.<br>

            Siwas stares off into space.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Whoa."<br>
            <br>
            You find yourself standing in a large heavy cauldron filled
            with thick oil.&nbsp; You can hear the flickering of flames
            dancing around its sides.<br>
            <br>
            You rock violently back and forth knocking over the
            cauldron!&nbsp; The oil and you spill over the wall onto the
            attackers below.&nbsp; Screams of agony ring in your ears as
            you plummet towards the ground.<br>
            The area suddenly becomes very dark and you slump to the
            ground.<br>
            <br>
            When you awake, you realize you're back in the cave.<br>
            <br>
            [Vipershroud, A Large Cave]<br>
            The tunnel opens up into a large granite cave.&nbsp; On one
            wall is a carving that looks like a celestial diagram of
            some sort.&nbsp; Imbedded into the carving are seven stars
            fashioned from gems.&nbsp; Near the carving is an altar of
            rough granite covered by a scorched and mildewed crimson
            cloth edged in gold, a crimson-bound journal lies open at
            its base.&nbsp; A draft swirls through the area, carrying
            with it the sounds of voices whispering urgently.&nbsp; An
            occasional bone-chilling scream of anguish pierces the room.<br>
            Also here: Armaxis who is lying down, Siwas who is lying
            down<br>
            Obvious exits: west<br>
            <br>
            The topaz star begins to glow.<br>
            <br>
            One of the scorched pages in the journal lightens and
            becomes legible.<br>
            <br>
            (Siwas glances down at the flames, and sighs resignedly.)<br>
            <br>
            You blink.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas blinks.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "..well, that worked."<br>
            <br>
            You stand back up.<br>
            Roundtime: 3 sec.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I'm not burnt."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "My cloak didn't even get singed."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas stands up.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Pity."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "See, it's all just nightmares."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas murmurs a simple, mystical chant...<br>
            <br>
            You dust yourself off.<br>
            <br>
            You push the amethyst star and you hear a slight *click*.<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly, your vision fades and the air is filled with
            piercing cries of agony.<br>
            Interspersed with the screams you hear a voice reciting.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I said it often, said it loud,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I am nothing, if not proud.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; A straightened back and unbended knee<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Were my parents only legacy.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I fear no man, no beast, no foe,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; but nightmares still can bring me low,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; and teach me what I need to know.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; As your vision clears and the air quiets, you
            discover you are not where you were.<br>
            <br>
            [Village Square]<br>
            You find yourself tied to a sturdy stake in the middle of a
            large village square filled with angry townsfolk, their
            vitriolic cries ringing in your ears.&nbsp; A massive pile
            of stones fills the area in front of the stakes.<br>
            Obvious exits: none<br>
            Armaxis arrives, looking a bit disoriented.<br>

            <br>
            A raggedy dwarf picks up a large stone from the pile and
            hurls it at Armaxis, screaming, "You're guilty!"&nbsp; The
            stone hits him squarely on his abdomen!&nbsp; Oh, the pain!<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Uh."<br>

            <br>
            &gt;laug<br>
            It's impossible to do very much while tied to a stake.<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "Yeah!"<br>
            <br>

            An angry dwarf picks up a large stone from the pile and

            Suddenly, your vision fades and the air is filled with
            piercing cries of agony.<br>
            Interspersed with the screams you hear a voice reciting.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp; Silent is the viper, silent as the grave.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Silent are the stars, silent are the brave.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp; But nightmares are not silent; nothing's what
            it seems.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The music of the snake is music full of
            screams.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; And the logic of Sheru is the logic of
            extremes.<br>

            as they writhe over each other and around your body.&nbsp;

            Armaxis raises his faded scroll and gestures.<br>
            Sparks begin to fly between the faded scroll and Armaxis's
            fingers.<br>
            With a sudden burst of enthusiasm, the sparks jump into
            Armaxis's hand and he seems to glow with power.<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis gestures at a writhing mass of snakes.<br>
            You watch in amazement as the snakes start to sway and coil
            around each other, eventually forming a ladder that reaches
            up through the darkness of the pit!<br>

            choking the lungs and obscuring vision.&nbsp; The only sound
            is the obscene burbling of pockets of vile gases rising to
            the surface of the lake.&nbsp; Barely visible through the
            miasma an amorphous humanoid figure stands silhouetted
            against the lava.<br>

            emanates from his body.&nbsp; The man seems intensely sad.<br>

            garments.&nbsp; Then, just as suddenly, the figure

            <br>
            &gt;read jour<br>
            Written on the inside cover in an elegant script are the
            words:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven stars, seven tasks,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven fears to subdue.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven times you must unmask<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The seven nightmares of Sheru.<br>
            <br>
            The pages of the journal begin to flip rapidly, filling the
            air with their staccato rhythm.&nbsp; You sense you have
            survived a grueling ordeal from which few have emerged with
            their sanity intact.<br>
            <br>
            You hear the voices of the curators echo in your head,
            "Ahhh, you have done well, Juspera!&nbsp; We are grateful
            for your efforts, but it seems you have solved this puzzle
            already!"<br>
            <br>
            You nod.<br>
            <br>
            You shudder.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas smiles at you.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "You were afraid, in front of that mob."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Sheru's dumb."<br>
            <br>
            You stare at Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Well, they were throwing rocks at me."<br>
            <br>
            You scratch your ear.<br>
            <br>
            Siwas says, "Perhaps I can bribe that priest of Solhaven to
            pay you a visit sometime."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "And I didn't do anything."<br>
            <br>
            You say, "It wasn't my fault."<br>
            <br>
            You scowl at Siwas.<br>
            <br>
            You remove a long-necked bottle from in your cloak.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at the long-necked bottle and take a tentative
            sip.<br>
            The liquid tastes strangely of cinnamon.&nbsp; You feel
            suddenly light-headed...and realize you are actually
            floating a foot or so above the floor!&nbsp; A sense of
            well-being drifts over you as you slowly settle back on your
            feet.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "That's better."<br>
            <br>
            Siwas raises an eyebrow.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;put bott in cloak<br>
            Hmm, perhaps you shouldn't take things that don't belong to
            you.<br>
            <br>
            &gt;rgam van sil bot in cloak<br>
            You secretly place your long-necked bottle into your cloak.<br>
            Roundtime: 2 sec.<br>
            <br>
            Armaxis stares off into space.<br>
