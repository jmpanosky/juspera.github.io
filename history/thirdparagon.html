              attempted to take out two of Raznel's paragons. I don't

            townsfolk, travellers, and adventurers meet to talk,
            conspire or raise expeditions to the far-flung reaches of
            Elanith.&nbsp; At the north end, an old well, with
            moss-covered stones and a craggy roof, is shaded from the
            moonlight by a strong, robust tree.&nbsp; The oak is tall

            You see Sentinel Jerram Happersett.<br>
            He appears to be a Human.<br>
            He is average height. He appears to be past his prime. He
            has brooding navy blue eyes and weathered skin. He has
            short, thinning light brown hair evenly streaked with hints
            of grey. He has an unshaven face, a broken nose and cleft
            chin and shadowy black veins beneath his mouth and eyes.<br>
            He is in good shape.<br>
            He is holding a gleaming gold-runed maul in his right hand.<br>

            lances on a field of silver, a pair of mithril-scaled
            gauntlets, some crisp black pants, some etched silvered

            You say, "Um."<br>
            <br>
            Goblyn gazes with interest at Jerram.<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart asks, "They who?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar bites his lip.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia asks, "Who has promised this?"<br>
            <br>
            Iseo says, "I think they are fairly glorious already."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Ysharra says, "You've got an interesting
            theory."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Geijon asks, "Are you insane?"<br>
            <br>
            Xorus asks, "Freedom from the cursed affliction of the
            daemons of old, the wailing and the gnashing of teeth?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Ysharra, Dergoatean says, "It's not that
            interesting until he explains what the heck he's talking
            about."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Thrassus says, "Tell us more, I am
            intrigued."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "To where our scattered bodies go, sounds
            like."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Geijon says, "You are a sentinel of th'
            Empire. Get your bearings and act like one."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking deeply to himself, Guarrin mutters, "Oh, hasn't
            realized the situation yet."<br>
            <br>
            You nod slowly at Guarrin.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "They have to be shown the truth."<br>
            <br>
            Bristenn inwardly sighs.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking offhandedly to Chamorr, Leafiara says, "It's an
            interesting question. Until now we've just kinda watched
            them kill themselves--one realizing what happened and the
            other not realizing."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "I understand you may not trust us."<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Mnar, "The paragons... the
            phylacteries... don't realize what they are. And that
            they're in an illusion. They think they're still fully
            alive."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "But it is true. It is proven."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking softly to Jerram, Razanetika asks, "Why should we
            trust you?"<br>
            <br>
            Xorus asks, "Indeed?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Ysharra says, "We don't know you.&nbsp;
            Save by the words you speak, so say on."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "You need not worry."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram moves to stand in front of Razanetika.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram nods at Razanetika.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "You are pure."<br>
            <br>
            You see Razanetika the Nightstalker.<br>
            She appears to be an Elf.<br>
            She is shorter than average.&nbsp; She appears to be very
            young.&nbsp; She has sultry jade green eyes and ivory
            skin.&nbsp; She has waist length, tied back deep red hair
            twined into an intricate, braided knot resting over her
            right ear and held into place by a pair of rigid mithglin
            hairsticks with multicolored swirls.&nbsp; She has a round
            face, a small nose and slightly upswept pointed ears.&nbsp;
            She has swirling pure silver glaze brushed onto her lengthy
            manicured fingernails.<br>
            Miniature black cats spiral outward from her before fading
            away.<br>
            She is in good shape.<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "Look at you."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "...and look at them...."<br>
            <br>
            You fidget.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram glances at Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Razanetika glances at Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            Razanetika glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram glances at Thrassus.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra's face turns slightly pale.<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera swallows audibly.)<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus's eyes crinkle slightly at the edges.<br>
            <br>
            Melikor curls his lip at Jerram, his face contorting in a
            disdainful smirk.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking quietly to Jerram, Pukk says, "I know I know..but
            she isn't a statue...I swear."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim snickers at Cryheart.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Faendryl, Dergoatean says, "Knowing a bit of
            history makes this delusion even funnier."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Faendryl, Ysharra says, "Funny and sorrowful."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram asks, "Who among the dark will seek transformation?"<br>
            <br>
            (Lylia draws her lips back from her teeth in an expression
            that might be termed a smile if it had anything of warmth or
            civility about it.)<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Dergoatean asks, "By the dark, I suppose
            you're talking about me?"<br>
            <br>
            Leafiara bemusedly says, "Well, good luck with that one."<br>
            <br>
            You see Dergoatean the Nuisance.<br>
            He appears to be a Faendryl Dark Elf.<br>
            He appears to be very young.&nbsp; He has crystal green eyes
            and brown skin.&nbsp; He has short, auburn hair worn in a
            single braid.<br>
            He is in good shape.<br>
            He is holding a silvery blue mithril pike in his right hand.<br>
            ...<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Thrassus says, "Tell us about this
            transformation process."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Dergoatean asks, "What would you
            transform me into?"<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "Tell, no, we must show you."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram exclaims, "We have had many successes!"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Ysharra asks, "Who are we, and they?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra says, "Always this pronoun game."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Dergoatean says, "Well now that's not
            much of a sales pitch.&nbsp; You haven't even told me what
            the end result is supposed to be before saying you want to
            transform me."<br>
            <br>
            Bristenn offhandedly remarks, "Good and evil are oft twisted
            and subjective.&nbsp; The law, though-"<br>
            <br>
            Bristenn simply notes, "That is written."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Dergoatean says, "If I went around
            promising to turn people into... something!&nbsp; Well
            they'd have me committed."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Dergoatean says, "Think about this from
            my perspective."<br>
            <br>
            You idly scratch your neck.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram exclaims, "Restored!"<br>
            <br>
            Jerram exclaims, "To your pure elven form!"<br>
            <br>
            Jerram exclaims, "Before the curse!"<br>
            <br>
            You raise your hand.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I want to be transformed."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "If we are to be purified, then perhaps you
            should be purified as well."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Jerram.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Dergoatean says, "Ooohhhh you think this
            is a curse."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Dergoatean laughs at Jerram!<br>
            <br>
            Goblyn approvingly says, "I do think I do like him."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus asks, "Ah, before the Scorch, hm?"<br>
            <br>
            Xorus wryly says, "I am willing to take their curses into
            myself, truly it is a sacrifice worth making for their
            purity."<br>
            <br>
            You quickly exclaim, "No! I want it! Transform me!"<br>
            <br>
            You shoot your hand into the air, waving it frantically,
            then use your other hand to raise it even higher, your
            entire body wiggling with excitement.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar pulls on you, trying to get you closer.<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Mnar.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram asks, "YES!?"<br>
            <br>
            Jerram peers quizzically at you.<br>
            <br>
            You nod at Jerram.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Yes."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram asks, "You wish to be restored?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Ysharra asks, "Are you sure...?"<br>
            <br>
            Ruffelin glances between Jerram and yourself.<br>
            <br>
            Goblyn glances between Jerram and yourself.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Geijon says, "Do you know what you are
            doing? You are th' Eastern Sentinel. We are knights under
            oath of th' Northern Sentinel. You, sire, are making no
            sense to us."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking softly to Jerram, Razanetika asks, "Are you saying
            I cannot be transformed if I so desired it?"<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I --"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar frowns.<br>
            <br>
            Iseo smiles at you.<br>
            <br>
            You nod slowly at Jerram.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar whispers, "What are you doing, thief?"<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Mnar, "I hate being this way."<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart says, "He wants to transform Faendryl into pure
            elves."<br>
            <br>
            Iseo says, "Let's allow Juspera to at least finish her
            thought."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Faendryl, Dergoatean asks, "Is he one of the
            paragons?&nbsp; Shall we keep listening to this or just do
            what we came here to do?"<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers, "What do you think he'll do to you?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Lylia asks, "If she is made pure, you
            should prove your own purity as well. If you walk in light,
            then how may we follow you unless we know it for certain?"<br>
            <br>
            You fidget.<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Ysharra, "He'll make me not dark
            elven."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "Well."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann glances around the area.<br>
            <br>
            Goblyn glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            You squirm.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "I --"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Faendryl, Lylia says, "He is one of them. But as
            with the other Paragons, there appears to be no way to wound
            them permanently unless they are made to see..."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking dubiously to you, Cruxophim mutters, "You alright?"<br>
            <br>
            Maags turns an inquisitive ear toward you.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar whispers, "Well, we think you're fine the way you are."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim leans softly against Goblyn.<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra whispers, "This is all an illusion.&nbsp; All this
            man is, is part of Naimorai's agenda."<br>
            <br>
            You scratch your ear.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Faendryl, Dergoatean says, "I... see."<br>
            <br>
            You frown at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in lightly accented Faendryl, Goblyn says, "He does
            have it backwards, though.&nbsp; He should be making the
            'pure' elves more like you."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Ysharra says, "But illusions..."<br>
            <br>
            As Arasleaf moves to attack Jerram, the icy blue light
            surrounding his body intensifies in frequency and
            solidifies!&nbsp; Suddenly, the light violently flares out
            toward Arasleaf!<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; ... 1 point of damage!<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; A chilly blow to the stomach winds Arasleaf!<br>
            <br>
            Jerram stands in front of you.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Ysharra says, "And dreams.&nbsp; Can kill."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Faendryl, Lylia says, "Of course. We know this.
            The man is misguided."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Iseo says, "You can change your mind.
            Whatever you choose I support you."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram gestures at Arasleaf, and a column of shadows rises
            up and engulfs him, tossing him through the air like a rag
            doll!&nbsp; The pillar of darkness melts into the ground.<br>
            <br>
            Guarrin glances between Jerram and yourself.<br>
            <br>
            You wearily say, "I'm tired of being... who I am."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Ysharra, you say, "You should know that."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "Yes...yes of course."<br>
            <br>
            Iseo says, "Not that my support counts for much."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim cocks his head at you.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Iseo says, "But there you go."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in lightly accented Faendryl to Lylia, Goblyn says,
            "You're the progress in evolution -- what to strive for --
            for the elves."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking dubiously to you, Cruxophim inquires, "What are you
            choosing?"<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus folds his arms serenely in front of him as he
            watches you contemplatively, the roomy sleeves of his robes
            concealing his hands completely.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram asks, "What is your name?"<br>
            <br>
            Mnar frowns.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram turns an inquisitive ear toward you.<br>
            <br>
            You glance uneasily over your shoulder.<br>
            <br>
            You ask, "Me?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Faendryl to Goblyn, Dergoatean says, "It's this
            whole business of them and us and pure and not... I'm just
            one of me."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Ysharra says, "You should also know to be
            wary of prophets."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You say, "Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram exclaims, "You shall be our first this eve!"<br>
            <br>
            Leafiara leans over and whispers, "I do like your plan.
            Needed someone to volunteer so he can see how it doesn't do
            anything and maybe wake up from all this madness."<br>
            <br>
            Leafiara gives you a strong, encouraging smile.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Shinann says, "I am not sure this is a good
            idea."<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Leafiara, "It's not going to do
            anything?"<br>
            <br>
            Melikor glances dubiously at you.<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart asks, "Ye really asking for this?"<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart glances at you.<br>
            <br>
            Leafiara whispers, "...well... I highly doubt it, anyway!"<br>
            <br>
            Iseo says, "Pick Sylvan if you can. They have pretty
            voices."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram turns an inquisitive ear toward you.<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim signals, "Wonderful, another purity obsessed twit
            on his bully pulpit."<br>
            <br>
            Ysharra sighs.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Elven, Shinann says, "You do not know what will
            happen."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking heartily to you, Chamorr says, "Carefull what you
            wish for."<br>
            <br>
            You take a deep breath.<br>

            Suddenly, a brilliant wave of purple light ripples across

            [Talador, Battlefield]<br>
            The field is vast, stretching out for miles and miles of
            blemished and broken lands.&nbsp; Patches of wild grass and
            thin saplings struggle up from the ground, trying to
            flourish in the ground once soaked in blood.&nbsp;&nbsp; You

            Speaking in Elven, Leafiara speculates, "I think nothing
            will happen. And he needs to see that so--"<br>
            <br>
            Evia says, "Bah."<br>
            <br>
            Bristenn slowly reasons, "What harm might it do?&nbsp; The
            late Earl is under the sway of this ..pocket, and the wit-"<br>
            <br>
            You exclaim, "No!"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia whispers, "I would not gainsay you in this. But I
            understand your weariness, though you never knew the full
            glory of your birth. Perhaps one day we can --"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Elven, Leafiara surprisedly says, "Hm."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking patiently in lightly accented Faendryl to
            Dergoatean, Goblyn explains, "Racial hierarchies exist for

            Thrassus curses fluently.<br>

            In one blurring motion, Bristenn snatches a cross-hilted

            Cryheart asks, "What the?"<br>
            <br>
            Leafiara musingly says, "And there's our other one."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Brumas, Dergoatean exclaims, "Ello!"<br>
            <br>
            Iseo says, "This is different."<br>

            You fearfully glance at Lylia.<br>

            Speaking affably to Brumas, Cruxophim muses, "Oh, hi."<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart says, "Hello."<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart nods at Brumas.<br>
            <br>
            Mnar whispers, "Back to this."<br>
            <br>
            Brumas exclaims, "BREACH!"<br>
            <br>
            Hero Brumas just went northeast.<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Lylia, "It seems I lost my chance."<br>

            The walls of the earthen chamber are darkened by age and old
            blood.&nbsp; Chains hang from the ceiling, some with hooks
            still stained with fresh blood.&nbsp; Set into the ground is
            a dark red sigil, a deep gold sigil, and a shadowy black
            sigil.&nbsp; You also see a pile of dark elven corpses and a

            lacerations.&nbsp; Their blood has pooled along the ground
            and long ago permanently stained it.<br>

            Evia says, "Ghastly."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Faendryl, Lylia hisses, "Visions. Only visions."<br>

            <br>
            Speaking affably to you, Cruxophim advises, "Follow your
            heart."<br>
            <br>
            Xorus gestures at a dark red sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Geijon says, "Or you are about to."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "Please."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram points at a stained stone slab.<br>
            <br>
            The voice of Gryzzlbok says, "Being an elf cant be the worst
            thing in the world, you could be a dwarf."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Ysharra asks, "Perhaps it's not the dark
            elves who were hardened, hm?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking heartily to Jerram, Chamorr asks, "What year is
            this?"<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "Lie down on that.&nbsp; I will wait for the
            others."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Geijon says, "Stop, Juspera."<br>
            <br>
            Evia says, "No no no no."<br>
            <br>
            You reach out and touch a stained stone slab.<br>
            <br>
            Shinann whispers, "This sounds all wrong..."<br>
            <br>
            Evia stands in front of you.<br>
            <br>
            You glance uneasily at Jerram.<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart points at a pile of dark elven corpses.<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart looks over at you and shakes his head.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Ruffelin asks, "Wha' d'ye expect ta
            happen ta Juspera when ye transform 'er.&nbsp; Kin ye
            explain ta us, please?"<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus whispers, "Who knows? It might work."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Thrassus.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Ruffelin asks, "An' if wha' happens is
            different frae wha' ye expect, will&nbsp; ye listen ta us?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Geijon says, "Your corruption is
            absolute."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Ruffelin, Evia exclaims, "That pile be his
            failures, he failed and thats what happens!"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Ruffelin, Goblyn says, "He does wish to show,
            not to be doing this explaining."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Ysharra, you whisper aloud, "What's going on?"<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus whispers, "He does have an aura of power about
            him."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Ysharra asks, "It's like your cave, isn't
            it?"<br>
            <br>
            You feel the blood drain from your face.<br>

            &gt;l<br>
            [Wasteland Cavern, Purity Tomb]<br>
            The walls of the earthen chamber are darkened by age and old
            blood.&nbsp; Chains hang from the ceiling, some with hooks
            still stained with fresh blood.&nbsp; Set into the ground is
            a dark red sigil, a deep gold sigil, and a shadowy black
            sigil.&nbsp; You also see a volatile aurora spirit that is
            flying around, the palm frond-shaped Leafiara disk, a pile
            of dark elven corpses and a stained stone slab.<br>
            Also here: Dergoatean, Miss Goblyn who is sitting, Lord

            <br>
            You nod at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Ysharra asks, "How changed were we when we
            left?"<br>
            <br>
            You furrow your brow, probably adding a wrinkle or two in
            the process.<br>

            (Lylia moves closer to the shadowy black sigil until she
            stands just beside it.)<br>
            <br>
            Leafiara looks thoughtfully at you.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Ysharra says, "This isn't going to end like
            you hope.&nbsp; Or how he wants."<br>
            <br>
            Lylia points her clockwork staff at the area directly in
            front of her.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "Do not mind those."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram nods at Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Ruffelin asks, "Please, explain ta us
            wha' will occur durin' th' transformation process.&nbsp;
            Wha' should we expect ta see?"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia says, "Oh? And why not? I always mind most what people
            tell me not to mind..."<br>
            <br>
            You mumble, "I just thought... I was going to be a regular
            elf."<br>
            <br>
            (Lylia prods at the sigil with the silver-shod tip of her
            staff, not quite touching it.)<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "I do not think it will turn out that way..."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking thoughtfully to you, Cruxophim ventures, "It may
            still be possible."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Ruffelin asks, "An' if wha' happens
            isnae what ye describe ta us, will ye please hear us out?"<br>
            <br>
            Iseo says, "You are a wonderful elf just as you are. Don't
            listen to that puritanical idiot."<br>
            <br>
            The voice of Gryzzlbok says, "Those are just shed skins."<br>
            <br>
            Guarrin glances meaningfully at a pile of dark elven
            corpses.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Ysharra says, "I wonder if they thought the
            same."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking curiously in Elven to you, Leafiara says, "Would
            make more of a difference if that would be a different
            lifespan, but for you it wouldn't..."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking softly to you, Razanetika exclaims, "There is
            nothing wrong with the elf that you are!"<br>
            <br>
            Iseo says, "Dark light green yellow. Just be you."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking quietly to Lylia, Pukk asks, "What if I said not to
            mind minding what they want you to mind?"<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "Everyone is noise..."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gestures at a dark red sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "I mean... look at this cave."<br>
            <br>
            Poor baby!<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Ysharra says, "Including you."<br>
            <br>
            Xorus gestures at a shadowy black sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia thoughtfully taps a finger against her lips.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "Stop...and...be reborn."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You pick idly at a stained stone slab.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gestures at a shadowy black sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>

            Melikor gestures at a deep gold sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>

            Jerram says, "Please. Lay down on the slab."<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart says, "I think he dinnae recall the truth of the
            purification."<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            You frustratedly say, "I don't understand."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Geijon says, "You are no sentinel we can
            follow. We renounce your leadership."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Ysharra asks, "Has it ever worked?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Iseo says, "You shame me. You should not
            involve yourself this is not your place."<br>
            <br>
            Shinann says, "If you do not understand then do not do it."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus whispers, "What's the worst that could happen?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Lylia, Dergoatean says, "I'm tempted to start
            casting everything in the book at the sigil, but I'm not
            sure I want what happens next."<br>
            <br>
            Xorus gestures at a shadowy black sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Geijon says, "No just lord would state
            such a command."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking slowly to you, Goblyn says, "He is maybe making you
            -better-, in the way that he does see it as better."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "There is no need. Please cease that."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "I will not ASK YOU AGAIN."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram glances at Xorus.<br>
            <br>
            Xorus smirks.<br>
            <br>
            Melikor glances upward and whistles quietly, an innocent
            look on his face.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia notes, "You have not asked me once. You have ordered
            me."<br>
            <br>
            <i>Faendryl, man. Can't live with 'em, can't exterminate 'em
              and throw their bodies in a cave.</i><br>
            <br>
            Iseo asks, "Who gave him the right or mandate to do this?"<br>
            <br>
            Jerram stands in front of you.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia lightly says, "Ask anyone. I do not take kindly to
            orders."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "Please, on the slab."<br>
            <br>
            Geijon recites:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get ready to engage"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gestures at a shadowy black sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Ruffelin says, "Yer a brave lass.&nbsp;
            Wha' 'e expects will not occur.&nbsp; Ye'll disappear from
            'ere as Geijon did."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "Let us restore you to your elven form."<br>
            <br>
            You gaze with a bemused expression at Jerram.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gestures at a shadowy black sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>
            <br>
            Pukk quietly says, "Unless they order her to not take kindly
            to orders...then she gets confused."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking nervously to Jerram, you say, "I want to believe
            you, but you have to explain the bodies."<br>
            <br>
            Cruxophim calmly reminds, "It's her choice.&nbsp; That's
            what you lot go on about all the time, isn't it?&nbsp;
            Choice?&nbsp; Freedom?"<br>
            <br>
            Ruffelin nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            (Ysharra reaches down and pulls her cloak back, winding her
            forearm around a few twisting brambles, and lets the
            resultant wound drip over the dark red sigil, and looks at
            Juspera.)<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Ruffelin says, "Aye, git 'im ta tell ye."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Ysharra says, "You have heard these kinds
            of promises before."<br>
            <br>
            Pukk abruptly punches at a dark red sigil!<br>
            <br>
            Dergoatean gestures at a dark red sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "The bodies are those whose hearts were too
            hardened. Too dark still."<br>
            <br>
            You glance at Ysharra.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking pointedly to Ysharra, Cruxophim reminds, "So have
            I."<br>
            <br>
            Maags says, "It is her choice but she is confused."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "They did not survive."<br>
            <br>
            Goblyn grins slowly at Jerram.<br>
            <br>
            Evia says, "Baloney."<br>
            <br>
            Guarrin glances between Ysharra and yourself.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "I know you will."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Geijon asks, "Who can convince Juspera?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Goblyn, you whisper aloud, "But you could raise
            me if I died?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Ysharra says, "Then perhaps you are the
            one who needs to be transformed."<br>
            <br>
            Soneiken gestures at a shadowy black sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>
            <br>
            Pietra surreptitiously glances around the area.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Geijon, Leafiara muses, "...only herself."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking firmly to Ysharra, Cruxophim reminds, "And I'm
            still here because of it.&nbsp; Do you think what I would
            were it not for such would still be your ally?"<br>
            <br>
            Goblyn raises an eyebrow in your direction.<br>
            <br>
            Chamorr heartily says, "Sleep her."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Evia asks, "Where's the ones what made
            it???"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Ruffelin asks, "Sae, if 'er heart is too
            hard, she'll fall inta yer pile o' bodies, aye?"<br>
            <br>
            Iseo asks, "Do they look like they got raised?"<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gestures at a shadowy black sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>
            <br>
            Geijon says, "Our limit is close."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking amusedly to Goblyn, Cruxophim urges, "Do it."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking noncommittally to you, Goblyn says, "Maybe.&nbsp;
            Maybe not.&nbsp; It is depending on his methods."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Geijon exclaims, "Sentinel!"<br>
            <br>
            You fidget.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram stands in front of you.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Geijon says, "What are you doing? You
            have knights amongst you."<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart asks, "Are the corpses a result of the
            purification, Jerram?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Guildspeak, Lylia says something you don't
            understand.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram leans over and whispers, "Be free."<br>
            <br>
            Melikor nods at Lylia.<br>
            <br>
            You close your eyes for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Geijon says, "Stop him."<br>
            <br>
            Dergoatean gestures at a dark red sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>
            <br>
            You reach out and touch a stained stone slab.<br>
            <br>
            Goblyn looks thoughtfully at you.<br>
            <br>
            You sit down next to a stained stone slab.<br>
            <br>
            Ruffelin whispers, "Be brave."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Evia says, "Eh you been at this for
            centuries and not one good transform to show for it, just
            hulks."<br>
            <br>
            Evia points at a pile of dark elven corpses.<br>
            <br>
            Shadows dance between Lylia's outstretched fingers as she
            issues a command in archaic Faendryl.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gestures at a shadowy black sigil.<br>
            Lylia casts at the black sigil and one of the runes begins
            to flare with strong glow.<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gasps.<br>
            <br>
            Maags says, "She can stop him."<br>
            <br>
            Maags says, "If she wishes."<br>
            <br>
            Dergoatean gestures at a dark red sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>

            Nothing happens.<br>
            <br>
            Goblyn whispers, "If I cannot, it will be a new journey you
            are on, yes?&nbsp; This will be interesting, in either way
            it does go."<br>
            <br>
            Goblyn nods approvingly to you.<br>
            <br>
            Bristenn loudly sighs, "The corpses are not real.&nbsp; Nor
            is the ritual."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to you, Geijon says, "He is trapped a thousand
            years ago. This pains us all."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "You will survive it."<br>
            <br>
            Dergoatean says, "No dispelling it, detecting, removing
            disease or poison from it."<br>
            <br>
            Jerram nods to you.<br>
            <br>
            Jerram says, "I know you will."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, you say, "You don't know what I've
            done.&nbsp; I'm not so sure my heart's not... too far gone."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Iseo asks, "How do you know?"<br>
            <br>
            Dergoatean says, "And no uncursing it, either."<br>
            <br>
            Thrassus whispers, "Again, what is there to lose?"<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Guildspeak, Lylia says something you don't
            understand.<br>
            <br>
            Guarrin deeply says, "Makes you wonder. Did he actually do
            this, or just want to."<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Bristenn, Rasson says, "The corpses may not be,
            but I think the ritual will be effective... in something."<br>
            <br>
            Dergoatean gestures at a dark red sigil.<br>
            Nothing happens.<br>

            Speaking in Guildspeak, Lylia says something you don't
            understand.<br>
            <br>
            Bristenn reminds, "Recall the distorted fantasies the other
            phylacteries constructed.&nbsp; The late earl has clearly
            lost his wits."<br>
            <br>
            Soneiken says, "The third sigil is charged."<br>
            <br>
            Ruffelin says, "Allow Juspera ta follow through on this an
            be proof, as Geijon was."<br>
            <br>
            You pant, trying to catch your breath.<br>
            <br>
            Ruffelin says, "IF tha's 'er choice."<br>
            <br>
            Evia agrees with Bristenn.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking to Jerram, Geijon says, "I'd never follow your
            leadership as my liege."<br>
            <br>
            (Juspera lies back onto the slab.)<br>
            <br>
            You lie down.<br>

            Goblyn leans over and whispers, "Maybe this only reason I
            am... uncertain... of his doing this for you, is that he is
            maybe a liar.&nbsp; I do not like liars."<br>

            interesting!"<br>

            Xorus casts at the gold sigil and one of the runes begins to
            flare with strong glow.<br>
            <br>
            The sigil suddenly pulses with tendrils of essence, and

            Geijon says, "Stop him."<br>

            You tremble.<br>

            Jerram swings a gleaming gold-runed maul at you!<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp; Hard hit shatters your weapon arm.<br>
            You become solid again.<br>
            You suddenly feel less protected.<br>
            The deep blue glow leaves you.<br>
            Deep blue motes swirl away from you and fade.<br>
            The brilliant luminescence fades from around you.<br>
            The light blue glow leaves you.<br>
            Your sense of faith and conviction wanes.<br>
            You return to normal color.<br>
            <br>
            It seems you have died, my friend.&nbsp; Although you cannot
            do anything, you are keenly aware of what is going on around
            you...<br>
            <br>
            You mentally give a sigh of relief as you remember that the
            Goddess Lorminstra owes you a favor.<br>
            <br>
            ...departing in 10 mins...<br>
            <br>
            Lylia gasps.<br>
            <br>
            Evia screams!<br>
            <br>
            Geijon closes his eyes for a moment.<br>

            Cryheart frowns.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Leafiara gestures at you.<br>
            You feel a tingle on your soul, as if a powerful hand is
            gently cradling it.<br>
            (Thy soul is bound to thy body for an extra 47 minutes and
            30 seconds.)<br>

            Guarrin clenches his jaw.<br>

            Speaking to Jerram, Ysharra asks, "See?"<br>
            <br>
            Rasson says, "That did not work well."<br>
            <br>
            Cryheart says, "She still appears to be a dark elf."<br>

            Thrassus says, "Guess it didn't work after all."<br>

            Some sculpted tenebrous leathers vertically strapped at the
            ribcage partially deflects the onslaught of the crushing
            attack.<br>
            Jerram swings a gleaming gold-runed maul at Alasatia!<br>
            A heavy barrier of stone momentarily forms around Alasatia
            and blocks the attack!<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; You have an unpleasant sense of deja vu.<br>

            Cryheart glances at Jerram.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking in Faendryl, Lylia exclaims, "Only the red sigil
            remains!"<br>

            Melikor gestures at a deep gold sigil.<br>

            Iseo focuses on you with intense concentration, and you feel
            the feathery brush of her mental presence.<br>
            Your right arm wound gradually fades, forming on Iseo's
            right arm instead.<br>
            Your left leg wound gradually fades, forming on Iseo's left
            leg instead.<br>
            The gentle infusion of Iseo's strength restores you
            somewhat.<br>

            Bristenn slowly corrects, "..apparently the ritual is a
            hammering."<br>

            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Raelee, "I bet you killed a lot of
            them huh."<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Thrassus whispers, "Lylia and Xorus had dispelled two of
            those sigils before he hit you. That might have stopped the
            process from happening."<br>

            count, however.&nbsp; I could not provide numbers."<br>
            <br>
            You quietly whisper to Raelee, "Well good. Thanks for
            helping."<br>
